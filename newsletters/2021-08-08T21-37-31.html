<p>The macro portion of this report provides an update on this current virus wave, and then focuses on economic US business cycle indicators, new Fed repo facilities, and gold. Then there’s a BTC/ETH section to update some of the action in the digital asset ecosystem. The stock section takes a look at the energy sector again, to see the latest news.</p>
<p>As a housekeeping note, I just published a <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public article</a> on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.</p>
<h2>Macro View</h2>
<p>The world is in the middle of an upswing in cases and deaths attributed to the coronavirus, and the delta variant in particular:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-global-covid.png" alt="Global COVID-19" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-global-covid.png 619w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-global-covid-203x300.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" width="619" height="914"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldometer</a></em></p>
<p>At this rate it looks to be at last a few weeks away from the peak level, based on how long these peaks have taken in the past and how long these more recent delta peaks took in countries that are already past it. That’s not a medical opinion, just a quantitative observation on how these waves have gone so far around the world.</p>
<p>India had the delta variant first, and their cases and deaths have long since returned back to baseline. UK and Indonesia were some of the next to be hit after India, and they seem to be past their peak level now. The UK in particular emerged rather unscathed in terms of deaths. There was a big decoupling between reported cases and deaths this time, although we’re still seeing a bit of an uptick in cases:</p>

<p><em>Chart Source:&nbsp;Worldometer</em></p>
<p>The Times of London <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/658b3bc4-f518-11eb-8f01-2c678acbb979?shareToken=2969cf1de993c6f9c953e5d495dca282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that 94% of English adults have coronavirus antibodies at this point, from one source or another:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final phase of vaccination in adults, coupled with a surge of cases in young people, mean that 80 per cent of those aged 16-24 had antibodies in the week of July 12, up from 67 per cent two weeks earlier. Overall, 94 per cent of English adults have antibodies.</p>
<p>More than half of 16- and 17-year-olds have acquired their antibodies through infection, as ministers&nbsp;approve vaccination&nbsp;of all 1.4 million people in this age group yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Malaysia and several other southeast Asian countries look close to peaking. A number of other countries including the US and Australia are weeks behind them; still in the early/middle phase of the rise.</p>
<p>Death rates for the virus remain quite low overall, especially for people who don’t have key risk factors like advanced age and co-morbidities, and who vaccinations if they opted for them.</p>
<p>However, there are some concerning reports about long-term lingering symptoms for a subset of those infected by the virus, including persistent brain fog as one of the more commonly-reported issues.</p>
<p><strong>Virus Anecdote</strong></p>
<p>My mother contracted the delta variant in recent weeks, despite having received the full two-shot dose of the Moderna vaccine shortly after it became available for people earlier this year.</p>
<p>She is about 70, is immune-compromised, and has COPD (breathing difficulties), so she is in a high risk group and has spent the last year taking significant precautions to avoid getting the virus. After being vaccinated, she continued wearing a mask when out and about, and washing her hands with extra care when coming back home. She also got tested maybe a month ago to check her antibody levels and was confirmed to have them.</p>
<p>However, she became sick over the past two weeks and decided to get tested for the virus, and was found to have the delta variant. She believes she got it from attending her weekly religious service, which is her most social activity with a lot of close interaction.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she tolerated the virus well despite having multiple risk factors. She had significant flu-like symptoms but did not need hospitalization or anything like that. She now considers herself “99.9% recovered”, to use her words.</p>
<p><strong>The US Business Cycle</strong></p>
<p>Here is my updated heatmap of various economic indicators for the U.S. economy over the past five years, measured in year-over-year percent change terms. This lets us see a broad spectrum of the economy rather than cherry pick good or bad data points to fit a narrative. I don’t normally do this for two premium reports in a row, but we had a lot of new data come in.</p>
<p>The economy is at a high peak (the year-ago period was Q2 of last year, especially for the quarterly numbers like GDP) but is showing initial signs of entering a soft patch in rate-of-change terms, largely due to harder base effects, fiscal stimulus wearing off, and the delta variant.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-economic-heatmap.png" alt="Economic Heatmap" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-economic-heatmap.png 686w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-economic-heatmap-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" width="686" height="570"></p>
<p>The chart starts from the bottom and goes up over five years, and each column represents one of the economic indicators.</p>
<p>For most of the chart, I use a green/yellow/red color spectrum. Green indicates solid growth, yellow indicates medium, and orange/red indicate slow growth or contraction, relative to the rest of the 5-year period for that indicator. In other words, green is good and red is bad.</p>
<p>For inflation CPI, there is a separate blue/white/red color scale, because high or low inflation in a vacuum is not necessarily “good” or “bad” in the same way as the rest of the heat map. Red indicates higher price inflation, white indicates medium, and blue is lower price inflation, relative to the 5-year period. Economic slowdowns tend to be dis-inflationary while economic booms tend to be pro-inflationary, but there are also some business cycles that slow down with high inflation, and thus become “stagflationary”. So, inflation gets its own color scheme.</p>

<p>Although the economy is peaking in rate-of-change terms (it would be nearly impossible not to, after how low Q2 2020 dipped), the credit cycle still seems early. Banks, for example, are easing lending standards for both consumer and business loans. Here’s a snapshot for the percentage of banks tightening or loosening lending standards:</p>

<p>On the other end of the equation, demand for both consumer and business loans are picking up. Here’s a snapshot for business loan demand:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-loan-demand.png" alt="Loan Demand" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-loan-demand.png 647w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-loan-demand-300x209.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" width="647" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>Bank lending was pretty weak during the course of the prior decade, and is very weak currently, with rolling lockdowns and many structural shifts in consumer behavior and the broader economy. This next chart shows total bank loans in blue, and the year-over-year rate of change of those total loan levels in red:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-bank-loans.png" alt="Bank Loans" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-bank-loans.png 657w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-bank-loans-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" width="657" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>There was a spike in loan demand during the beginning of the pandemic because many businesses tapped into their existing credit revolvers to get extra cash on their balance sheets from their banks, just in case. As they paid those back, loan growth has been basically nonexistent.</p>
<p>However, lending standards have now relaxed, loan demand has picked up a bit, and as we look out past the delta variant wave, we should start to see at least a modest resumption in loan growth.</p>
<p><strong>Rent Inflation</strong></p>
<p>I think rent inflation is going to be higher than the market seems to expect. I wrote about this in my previous deep dive report from two weeks ago as well.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-rent-inflation.png" alt="Rent Inflation Chart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-rent-inflation.png 699w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-rent-inflation-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" width="699" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>If we look at faster-updating information, the rent numbers are pretty wild:</p>

<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apartments List</a></em></p>
<p>I see a narrative out there on financial social media that, because the Biden administration has attempted to extend the eviction mortarium, that this will keep a lid on rental prices. I see comments like, “nobody is paying rent, so how can rents go up?”</p>
<p>However, the vast majority of people are paying rent as normal. About 95% of people have been paying their rent by the end of the month, which is only a percentage point or two different than back in 2019, pre-pandemic:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-rent-payments.png" alt="Rent Payments" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-rent-payments.png 727w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-rent-payments-300x242.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" width="727" height="586"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.nmhc.org/research-insight/nmhc-rent-payment-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NMHC Rent Payment Tracker</a></em></p>
<p>Around the margins, there were indeed some effects from eviction moratoriums, and in a multi-trillion dollar economy, that can mean tens of billions of dollars of lost revenue for landlords, since they couldn’t remove non-paying tenants. Landlords are indeed challenging this latest extension of the eviction mortarium.</p>
<p>However, as it relates to measuring rent inflation, the eviction moratorium being extended for certain parts of the country should not materially affect this component of CPI, even if it may dull it a bit around the margins. It’s likely going up either way.</p>
<p>Used vehicle prices seem to be cooling off, but housing costs are a much larger piece of the CPI, and those are on the upswing in rate-of-change terms.</p>
<p>The big caveat is that there are still about 9 million people on various types of pandemic-specific unemployment programs in the country, and most of them will lose those benefits one month from now in early September. I’ll be paying close attention to rent payment percentages and other signs this autumn. There are record job openings and plenty of areas of labor shortage, so some percentage of those people will likely filter back into the job market.</p>
<p><strong>QE Taper Preparation: The Fed Standing Repo Facility</strong></p>
<p>At the end of July, the Fed <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728b.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two new standing repo facilities. These facilities let certain entities, domestic and foreign, loan Treasuries to the Fed in exchange for dollars:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday announced the establishment of two standing repurchase agreement (repo) facilities—a domestic standing repo facility (SRF) and a repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA repo facility). These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning.</p>
<p>Under the SRF, the Federal Reserve will conduct daily overnight repo operations against Treasury securities, agency debt securities, and agency mortgage-backed securities, with a maximum operation size of $500 billion. The minimum bid rate for repos under the facility will be set initially at 25 basis points, somewhat above the general level of overnight interest rates. Counterparties for this facility will include primary dealers and will be expanded over time to include additional depository institutions.</p>
<p>Under the FIMA repo facility, the Federal Reserve will enter into overnight repurchase agreements as needed with foreign official institutions against their holdings of Treasury securities maintained in custody at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The rate for this facility will be set initially at 25 basis points with a per counterparty limit of $60 billion. By creating a temporary source of dollar liquidity for FIMA account holders, the facility can help address pressures in global dollar funding markets that could otherwise affect financial market conditions in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is interesting, because right now there is zero demand for repo activities from the Fed. To the contrary, there is nearly a trillion dollars in demand for the Fed’s <em>reverse</em> repo operations. So why implement this?</p>
<p>It seems pretty clear that the Fed is preparing for a gradual taper in its rate of asset purchases. However, it’s unclear if there is enough private sector and foreign sector demand for Treasuries, at the rate of Treasury issuance that the US government plans over the next few years. Plus, the Fed doesn’t want a repeat of what happened in March 2020, where there was a global dollar shortage, the dollar spiked in value, and foreign entities had to sell Treasuries to get dollars. This resulted in the US Treasury market going illiquid with spiking yields, to which the Fed had to respond by buying $1 trillion worth of Treasuries in three weeks, with new money.</p>
<p>So, this set of new repo facilities is interesting, and a number of Fed officials have been talking about implementing them for a couple years. They basically make permanent the types of operations that the Fed did from late 2019 through early 2020. Going forward, certain domestic and foreign holders of Treasuries have assurances that, any time they need to, they can use their Treasuries as collateral with the Fed to get dollars. This increases the fungibility/liquidity of Treasuries with dollars.</p>
<p>At the end of this month, at the Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, there’s a good chance that the Fed will announce a plan to gradually taper their monthly asset purchases from the current rate of $120 billion. This will mean that the private sector and foreign sector need to absorb more of the US government’s Treasury issuance, and the standing repo facility is ready in the years ahead if those entities find themselves stuffed full of Treasuries and needing dollars.</p>
<p>The combination of an ongoing collateral shortage, improved fungibility between Treasuries and dollars, and notable inflation, should keep negative real yields for Treasuries in place for a while, which is a pretty smart way of doing informal yield curve control without formally pegging long-duration yields.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Bill</strong></p>
<p>The US Senate is coming close to passing a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.</p>
<p>This includes about a trillion dollars for roads, bridges, rail, ports, water systems, broadband, energy, and more. It’s spread over many years, so it’s more of a structural bill rather than a macro catalyst here in 2021.</p>
<p>It does not include several additional elements proposed by the Biden Administration, including an allocation towards caregiving of the aged and disabled, workforce development funding, Veterans’ affairs hospital modernization, and a corporate tax raise to pay for some of that. Basically, the Democrats’ plan included the concept of social infrastructure, while the bipartisan plan keeps it more limited to physical infrastructure. These other parts could be revisited in 2022 or 2023, and the odds for those things being passed depend on 2022 midterm election results as well as potential economic slowdowns in the coming years.</p>
<p>One of the things that hung up the 2,700 page $1 trillion infrastructure bill is a few paragraphs about digital asset tax regulation, of all things. In order to raise some revenue, the infrastructure bill would make brokers report gains for clients via a tax form, and report transactions of over $10,000. The goal is to improve tax enforcement on digital asset capital gains. Most of this is already happening at registered exchanges, but for example there are pockets like in DeFi where not a lot of people are paying taxes properly.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is how the bill defined “broker”:</p>
<blockquote><p>any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person</p></blockquote>
<p>This could conceivably include proof-of-work miners, proof-of-stake validators, Lightning node operators, hardware wallet makers, software developers, and all sorts of things that are otherwise not “brokers”. Normal everyday people running some Lightning nodes or running a proof-of-stake validator on Ethereum 2.0 when it is launched, could be brokers under that definition.</p>
<p>Basically, the inherent way that blockchains work, is that they are decentralized and multiple participants are involved in processing blocks of transactions, and they don’t know who to file the tax form on behalf of. It’s impossible.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like policymakers who haven’t used the internet yet trying to pass a bill in the mid-1990s for this “new internet technology”, and saying that hardware routers have to file tax forms “every time they route data packets that include an online payment” and that they have to include personal payment information for those counterparties in their tax filing. The builders and operators of the internet’s routers would naturally say, “Uh, we have no way to do that since they’re encrypted and we don’t know the payer/vendors involved. We’re happy to pay taxes and already do, but this particular method is unenforceable.”</p>
<p>The digital asset lobbyists pushed back on the poorly-described section in the bill, and senators were caught blindsided by this since they thought they would just slip it in but didn’t really know how to word it and didn’t expect this level of pushback. The digital asset industry has a market cap of over $1 trillion so they have some serious lobby firepower.</p>
<p>From there, there have been three different amendments to try to fix the language of the bill, and interestingly, the first two were bipartisan. This wasn’t a Democrat vs Republican issue, which is rare these days. The first bipartisan amendment explicitly clarified that they don’t mean miners/validators, hardware wallets, or software developers. The second competing bipartisan amendment, which was subsequently backed by the White House and Treasury Secretary Yellen, limited the exemptions to proof-of-work mining and hardware wallets (good for that group), but not software developers or proof-of-stake validators (bad for that group). So, that second one is fine for Bitcoin (except possibly for Lightning node operators and certain developers), and bad for Ethereum as a whole and the rest of DeFi.</p>
<p>Many in the industry argued that this second amendment is even worse, since they’re basically picking technology winners and losers now, and that it still doesn’t make sense and is hard to comply with. The concern among industry groups and some senators was that this hastily-written part of a big infrastructure bill would end up pushing innovation overseas, resulting in less tax enforcement rather than more, and the US partaking in a smaller share of growth from the industry than they otherwise would. US-based crypto companies in aggregate are on track to produce $10 billion in revenue this year, and US holders of digital assets collectively have hundreds of billions of dollars of taxable assets in this ecosystem.</p>
<p>Senator Ted Cruz proposed a third amendment that would remove this whole crypto tax enforcement piece from the bill and revisit this separately in the future, saying that this part of the must-pass bill is unworkable and threatens innovation.</p>
<p>As I finish this report on Sunday evening, it still hasn’t passed yet. They have discussed removing the amendments altogether. However, there are formal remarks by the Senators involved that the bill as written only applies to actual brokers. As the executive director of the major DC-based crypto think tank recently described:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-brito-tweet.png" alt="Brito Tweet" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-brito-tweet.png 613w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-brito-tweet-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" width="613" height="915"></p>
<p>However, it does remain a risk in the future that will be monitored by folks in the industry. We’ll see how the final language of the bill develops.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Update</strong></p>
<p>Gold continues to inversely follow real rates in terms of direction, as measured by 10-year Treasury yield minus forward inflation expectations by the TIPS market. However, it has been rather underwhelming in terms of magnitude:</p>

<p>If we go back more than a few years, we need to look at gold in rate-of-change terms, since of course the magnitude of gold’s price goes up over time. This next chart shows the year-over-year percentage change in the gold price, and the raw inflation-adjusted 10-year yield (meaning, not using TIPS forward expectations, since they don’t date back that far):</p>

<p>We have the deepest negative inflation-adjusted Treasury yields in 40 years, and normally that would be associated with a significant gold spike. Not this time though. Gold was a bit heated in summer of 2020, but other than that never really had a ton of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Lastly, if I compare the gold price to the broad money supply per capita, normalized to 100 in 1995, we can see that gold kept up with per-capita money supply growth. However, unlike prior periods of deeply negative real yields, gold didn’t greatly overshoot as one might expect it to:</p>

<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>I was asked a lot in the second half of last year and early this year if I thought bitcoin was responsible for the weak price action in gold, and my general answer was “maybe around the margins, but overall gold is still following real rates as it should”. However, as we’ve moved deeper into 2021, that continues to be true directionally, but not so much in terms of magnitude. Gold has been sluggish in terms of magnitude, given the favorable environment for it.</p>
<p>It could simply be that a strong S&amp;P 500 and strong dollar are currently headwinds. Historically, those things can be headwinds for gold, although gold can rally even when they are happening, since its inverse correlation with real rates tends to be the key variable.</p>
<p>However, I do think it’s possible that bitcoin, now worth over $700 billion, is taking a non-trivial amount of demand from gold. Factoring out central bank gold reserves and jewelry, and focusing on pure investment demand, gold’s market cap is estimated to be about $5 trillion. So, bitcoin is 10-15% of that level by this point, and more than that when you consider other digital assets. I think there would have been a bit more magnitude in gold’s price action in this environment, if bitcoin did not exist.</p>
<p>According to various surveys I’ve seen over the past couple years, there is approximate parity of ownership now in the United States. Roughly similar number of people report to own bitcoin as gold, which is pretty remarkable considering how young bitcoin still is.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean gold and bitcoin move inversely, or that many people trade between gold and bitcoin a lot. Instead, it simply means that a number of retail buyers and hedge funds, who would have otherwise bought gold as a hedge against fiat debasement, are instead buying some bitcoin. Many of them have explicitly said so; they buy bitcoin and say that if bitcoin didn’t exist, they’d have to buy gold instead.</p>
<p>A year ago in my <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/august-2020-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 2020 public newsletter</a>, shortly after gold had peaked, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crux of my answer is that I’m less bullish here at over $1,900 gold and over $25 silver in August 2020 than I was at sub-$1,300 gold and sub-$15 silver in 2018, but I’m still bullish with a multi-year outlook.</p>
<p>Short-term and/or intermediate-term consolidations or corrections are natural and even welcomed after such a quick uptrend in recent weeks, and investors may do well to consider rebalancing if they have generated large precious metal positions from the past couple years of outperformance.</p>
<p>My method of managing the liquid portion of my precious metal position through various price dips and price rips over the past two years has focused on maintaining a relatively static asset allocation. When precious metal prices surge higher, I allocate capital elsewhere to bring the allocation down a bit, and when it dips, I buy more to bring the allocation back up.</p>
<p>Caution is warranted at these levels, in my view, even within the context of an overall bullish outlook on the asset class. I am very uncertain of intermediate-term precious metal price action going forward, and honestly wouldn’t be surprised by a deeper correction, a period of sideways consolidation, or even a new breakout after this recent correction.</p>
<p>A portion of my bullishness in this specific time period has&nbsp;shifted to Bitcoin, which lagged gold and silver during the past couple years but has some specific bullish catalysts over the next year or two, mainly involving where it is in its halving cycle.</p>
<p>From 2018 into 2020, I was long precious metals with no position in Bitcoin. Then, I initiated a long position in Bitcoin about four months ago in April 2020, and have topped it off with some ongoing dollar-cost averaging into it. I think it has a fairly high likelihood of outperforming precious metals from now through the end of 2021, but we’ll see. I currently hold precious metals and Bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, overall this past year hasn’t been <em>too</em> surprising. Gold has consolidated down to the $1,700s range, and bitcoin rose from $12k to $40k+, which is in line with the expectation.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/premium-2021-3-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2021</a> however, I began getting a bit more bullish on gold again. It had a nice pop from that point through May and began confirming that idea, but then corrected again, and is now basically flat from March.</p>
<p>That’s pretty underwhelming. It started looking like it might make another bull run but then fizzled, even as inflation came in quite hot and real yields are deeper than they’ve been in decades. Sentiment is now very low within the industry, which I like as a bullish contrarian indicator. The sector seems pretty washed out now.</p>
<p>I remain bullish on gold with a multi-year view, and in particular I think this upcoming period of rent inflation as we head into the second half of the year represents another good catalyst for gold to bounce. However, we have to be cognizant of changing consumer preferences for monetary assets, which is why I like to hold both gold and bitcoin as part of my net worth, alongside equities and other assets.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Note</h2>
<p>For a while I’ve been saying that I need to see a breakout over $41k to become tactically bullish on bitcoin again, even though I already remain structurally bullish and long with a multi-year view since April 2020.</p>
<p>Well, bitcoin rose up and touched $42k, dipped to about $38k, made higher highs at $45k, and has since dipped to $43k/$44k. That looks pretty healthy.</p>

<p>Willy Woo, an on-chain bitcoin analyst, has been showing evidence of a supply shock forming in recent weeks. Bitcoin has been gradually moving from liquid “weak hand” addresses to illiquid “strong hand” addresses that often buy and rarely sell:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-strong-hands.jpg" alt="BTC Strong Hands" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-strong-hands.jpg 2192w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-strong-hands-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-strong-hands-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-strong-hands-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-strong-hands-1536x1027.jpg 1536w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-strong-hands-2048x1370.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2192px) 100vw, 2192px" width="2192" height="1466"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@woonomic</a></em></p>
<p>Here’s the supply/demand situation. Millions of people are dollar-cost averaging and “HODLing” their bitcoins, with little or no intention to sell any time soon. Institutions are gradually allocating as well. The center of bitcoin mining is moving to North America from China, and those new mining companies have better access to capital markets. So rather than selling newly-created bitcoins that they generate in order to pay their expenses, those miners are “HODLing” their bitcoins on their balance sheets indefinitely, rather than selling, and using equity or debt financing to pay their expenses.</p>
<p>This constitutes a supply shock. Supply is limited, and of that limited supply, not many bitcoins are liquid and available.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the weak hands that bought at the $50-$60k top this spring on the Grayscale neutral arbitrage pump without fully understanding what they held and why, have generally already sold.</p>
<p>This is reviving comparisons among bitcoin bulls to the 2013 double-pump bull run with a six-month correction in the middle.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-mvrv.png" alt="Bitcoin MVRV" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-mvrv.png 666w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-mvrv-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" width="666" height="710"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/mvrv-zscore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LookIntoBitcoin</a></em></p>
<p>Bitcoin has been broadly de-leveraged, with the Grayscale neutral arbitrage premium phased out, and with a lot of leveraged trades long-since liquidated. Sentiment and valuations have been reset. Meanwhile, people continue to dollar-cost average into it.</p>
<p>That being said, although various on-chain indicators look good here, I can’t know for sure how it will perform in terms of price over any 6-month period. My main thesis on it is more long-term oriented, and even that is simply a matter of probabilities and watching ongoing development and network effects. The bear case is that what bitcoin is doing now, is just a bull trap or dead cat bounce, with a lower-low ahead in this cycle.</p>
<p>Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity, has a good long-term chart on bitcoin that he updates from time to time:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-demand-model.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Demand Model" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-demand-model.jpg 679w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-btc-demand-model-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" width="679" height="388"></p>

<p>The blue dotted line is PlanB’s stock-to-flow model, which is a supply model. The pink dotted line is Timmer’s demand model, based on the idea of bitcoin being adopted by users about as quickly as mobile phones (which so far it has, with over 100 million users, but that pace might or might not continue).</p>
<p>Although the Bitcoin network’s decreasing stock-to-flow ratio is important, and supply flow halvings likely matter in terms of timing, I prefer the more conservative demand model. Without persistent demand, supply doesn’t matter. I continue to watch network user adoption demand.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Note</h2>
<p>Ethereum broke above the $2,900 threshold that I’ve been mentioning, which I’ve said would renew my base case towards a tactical bull scenario:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-eth-price.png" alt="ETH Price" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-eth-price.png 664w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-eth-price-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" width="664" height="480"></p>
<p><strong>Huge Bull Item: Ethereum Supply Shock</strong></p>
<p>Ethereum hard-forked into the EIP 1559 protocol a few days ago, after months of planning by developers, which changed Ethereum’s monetary policy to become more disinflationary. For each Ethereum block that is produced, some variable amount ETH is now burned (destroyed) depending on transaction volumes, and a small amount is issued depending on staking volumes, and so far since the hard fork, more is being burned than issued, making the protocol outright deflationary.</p>
<p>At the same time, millions of ETH coins are being locked up in the staking contract in anticipation of the launch of Ethereum 2.0, which still has no firm launch date but seems to be aiming for 2022 now. Those coins can’t unlock until Ethereum 2.0 launches.</p>
<p>The result is a supply shock, with ETH leaving exchanges even faster than BTC:</p>

<p>Plus, there is currently another round of NFT mania. The CryptoPunks, a set of 10,000 individual punk images were generated back in 2017 as some of the earliest NFTs and are in particular demand at the moment. The most popular ones (the small number of aliens, apes, and zombies in the collection whereas the vast majority are human) are selling for millions of dollars, and the low-end ones are selling for over $100k.</p>
<p>This is what they look like, with actual prices paid:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-cryptopunks.png" alt="Crypto Punks" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-cryptopunks.png 485w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-cryptopunks-188x300.png 188w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" width="485" height="776"></p>

<p>Anyone can copy the JPEG files like I have here. However, what someone gets when they pay six or seven figures for one of these purposely low-quality-but-hip images, is the blockchain proof that they’re the owner of it. That’s it. It becomes a status icon; people can use them as their avatars on social media, and show proof on the blockchain that they actually own it. It’s kind of like having the signed print from the creator, rather than just one of many copied prints.</p>
<p>And now of course the NFTs have become a major speculation- crypto hedge funds and wealthy traders are buying hundreds of them and stashing them into collections, and can resell them in the future. The idea is that if Ethereum is successful in the long run and becomes a multi-trillion dollar smart contract ecosystem, then some of the original NFTs would permanently be worth quite a bit for historical reasons. The bear view is that these end up being seven-figure beanie babies when we look back on this.</p>
<p>The most expensive trading cards in the world are worth a few million dollars, so I guess I’m not one to judge what art is. However, I could get a set of Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Wayne Gretsky, and Tom Brady rookie cards, along with the rarest Black Lotus card from Magic the Gathering, and the first edition Charizard card from Pokemon, together for less money than that top alien CryptoPunk. I think I’d take all of those cards over that, but what do I know. The risk/reward certainly doesn’t look compelling to me.</p>
<p>There is a nearly identical list of CryptoPunks that run on the Solana blockchain, called SolPunks. The most expensive ones are cheaper than the cheapest Ethereum ones, since the Solana blockchain is newer and with a weaker network effect than Ethereum. It has some interesting technology for enterprise-grade scaling, though.</p>
<p>In addition to the CryptoPunks which are some of the earliest NFTs, there are other sets of early Ethereum NFTs called Mooncats that are selling for very high numbers. There is also a set of 100 low-resolution pictures of rocks, that are each selling for five or six figures.</p>
<p>In the long run, I think we’ll see a flood of NFTs from major entities like Disney (DIS), Warner Media (T), Hasbro (HAS), the NFL, the NBA, and famous musicians (many have already released a bunch) on various blockchains, so total supply is certainly not limited and they’ll find a way to exhaust buyer demand for these types of assets, with probably only a tiny percentage of the assets holding onto long-term value, assuming the Ethereum blockchain remains successful in the long run.</p>
<p>I’d rather own bitcoin and resource companies and healthcare companies and good tech stocks, personally, than blockchain-signed JPEGs. I stick to what I know, and I surely don’t know art.</p>
<p><strong>Significant Bear Tail Risk: SEC Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, is stepping up its enforcement on cryptos. Gary Gensler, chairman of the SEC, gave a big speech about it last week.</p>
<p>Bitcoin itself is classified as a commodity, not a security, and Gensler has praised its technological innovations several times. However, many cryptos in the space are considered to be securities. So far, the SEC has not been very clear about how it classifies digital assets as securities or not securities, although there is pretty clear legal precedent.</p>
<p>The SEC has historically had conflicting views on Ethereum as it pertains to regulation (specifically, whether “ether” or “ETH” is a security or commodity). On one hand, they’ve said that basically any crypto that does an initial coin offering, is a security. Ethereum did an initial coin offering back in 2014, and its creator even compared their initial coin offering to Ripple (which is now being sued by the SEC for selling their own allegedly-unlicensed securities called XRP). On the other hand, the SEC (under the previous chairman, rather than Gensler) has previously said that ETH, like BTC, is not a security.</p>
<p>However, BTC unlike ETH, had no initial coin offering. BTC was released to the public and mined from scratch in public with no pre-mine, unlike ETH. Nobody even knows who the creator of BTC is besides his pseudonym, since he stepped away from the project early on and left it to volunteers to continue. There was never a central foundation that raised capital for the Bitcoin network or operated it.</p>
<p>Unlike Ripple Labs which continued to sell XRP tokens each year, the Ethereum Foundation sold all of its tokens in 2014 in one big chunk over several months, and therefore seems to be well past the legal statute of limitations for certain legal actions. That doesn’t necessarily mean that their token ETH isn’t a security, which could come with various implications if it ends up being the case. Those implications may or may not affect price, since XRP has been able to levitate despite ongoing legal issues from the SEC.</p>
<p>Gary Gensler has been making the media rounds, and he made clear the list of attributes of a security, referencing prior US Supreme Court decisions. Rohan Vora <a href="https://twitter.com/rohunvora/status/1423082183195983874" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a funny video</a> last week outlining how directly Ethereum matches the SEC’s definition of a security, as Gensler describes it. Basically, if a group raises money selling a new coin, and there is an anticipation of profits based on the efforts of that group, then it’s a security. The Ethereum Foundation sold coins as a pre-mine in an initial coin offering to raise money, along with promises for development, marketing, branding, and business plans from their team, with publicly-stated anticipation of token price appreciation to benefit the Ethereum Foundation and those who buy in.</p>
<p>So it remains to be seen how the SEC will enforce this over the next year. Will ETH be grandfathered in due to the statute of limitations and sufficient decentralization, or is it a security, which it seems to be? Either way, Gary Gensler made it clear that many coins that trade on centralized exchanges and Ethereum DeFi protocols are securities, even if they decide ETH itself is not. And the SEC could label something to be a security and prevent third parties from selling it, even if the SEC can’t go after the originator of the token pre-sale due to expired statutes. It’s all very complex, subject to interpretation, and I’m not a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>ETH Summary</strong></p>
<p>Overall, although I don’t view it as money, I view ETH as an interesting speculation, and for all intents and purposes basically a security.</p>
<p>One one hand, it’s a very well-designed bubble in the making, with staking that reduces existing liquid supply at least until Ethereum 2.0 comes out at an unidentified date, combined with the EIP 1559 hard fork to reduce new supply issuance and turn it deflationary. Over the next 6-12 months, this could be very powerful for ETH price appreciation. In a particularly bullish case, as momentum traders hop back onboard, Ethereum could very well outperform Bitcoin until the Ethereum 2.0 unlock. Right now, there is a ton of enthusiasm around digital art hosted on Ethereum.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one day we could randomly wake up and see ETH down 30% overnight because Gary Gensler says ETH is a security and that exchanges can’t sell it. Unlike the Bitcoin ecosystem which is inherently built to withstand state attacks, the Ethereum ecosystem has multiple centralized attack surfaces that regulators can go after in various ways, including the Ethereum Foundation and Consensys (which owns Infura and Metamask; two central parts of the Ethereum ecosystem, and which provides significant development for the main Ethereum chain and layer 2 scaling solutions), and various developers building out different parts of the DeFi ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Portfolio Updates</h2>
<p>I have a small number of changes for this week. The portfolios are available in my Google Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletter Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-Reduce dividend stock pie from 26% 25%, increase digital asset pie from 4% to 5%.</p>
<p>The digital assets pie is actually already 5% by now due to rapid price appreciation in recent weeks from the initial 4% allocation. I’m going to let it remain at that level, rather than rebalancing back to 4% where it started.</p>
<p>-Sell XOM and buy EOG in the commodity producer pie. I like both, but I prefer EOG’s lean business model at this time.</p>

<p>The delta variant of the virus is resulting in sporadic lockdowns around the world, which reduces oil demand. However, looking out 4-6 weeks into the future, the world as a whole should be past the delta variant and into the next re-opening cycle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the energy market remains pretty tight. OPEC+ isn’t flooding the world with supply, and the combination of ESG mandates and more shareholder-friendly management teams are keeping US oil production on a slow rebound rather than a quick one:</p>

<p>US oil production has a significant shale component with fast decline rates, so it takes continual capital to keep those production levels where they are, and extra capital to grow them. Production remains about 2 million barrels per day below the pre-pandemic peak.</p>
<p>Emerging markets still have rising oil consumption per capita, from levels that are far below the levels of the United States and other advanced markets. By 2022, I would expect China to be out of its current downward credit impulse, and ready to meaningfully increase oil consumption.</p>
<p>While I’m not a medical expert, it seems that the longer we go with this virus, more and more people will have been vaccinated, and then probably re-vaccinated, while other people develop natural immunity from getting the virus, and then some percentage of vaccinated people get the virus anyway, and the virus becomes less deadly over time as it becomes endemic in the population. On top of that, people in many regions are becoming less tolerant of lockdowns.</p>
<p>EOG Resources (EOG) is a good example of an energy producer that is practicing discipline. They are reducing debt and raising cash, and plan to further reduce debt over the next few years despite already having an A- credit rating.</p>

<p>The company is producing solid earnings and free cash flow in 2021, and is reasonably-valued:</p>

<p>The company doubled their hurdle rate for choosing where to put investment dollars earlier this year, with specific return targets even during fairly low energy prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The rest of the capital goes back to shareholders as dividends or towards strengthening the balance sheet. Here’s a description from their CEO in their earnings call from last week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our performance clearly proves the power of doubling our reinvestment hurdle rate.</p>
<p>Double premium requires investments to earn a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using flat commodity prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. I’m confident our reinvestment hurdle is one of the most stringent in the industry and a powerful catalyst to drive future outperformance across key financial metrics, including a return on capital employed and free cash flow.</p>
<p>As double-premium improves our potential to generate free cash flow, we remain committed to using that cash to maximize shareholder value. The regular dividends, debt reduction, special dividends, opportunistic buybacks, and small high return bolt-on acquisitions are our priorities.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, we reduced our long-term debt by 750 million and demonstrated our priority to returning cash, significant cash to shareholders with a commitment of 1.5 billion in regular and special dividends. We also closed on several low-cost, high potential bolt-on acquisitions, and the Delaware basin over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, we have committed 2.3 billion to debt reduction in dividends, which is slightly more than a 2.1 billion of free cash flow we generated. Looking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, our free cash flow priorities and framework have not changed.</p>
<p>As we generate additional free cash, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way. We are focused on doing the right thing at the right time in order to maximize shareholder returns.</p>
<p>Over the last 4 years, we made huge progress, reducing our GHG and methane intensity rates, nearly eliminating routine flaring and increasing the use of recycled water in our operations. We’re focused on continued progress towards reducing our GHG emissions in line with our targets and ambitions.</p>
<p>This quarter we announced the carbon capture and storage pilot project, which we believe will be our next step forward in the process of reaching our net 0 ambition. Ken will provide more color on this and other emission reduction projects in a few moments.</p></blockquote>
<p>EOG has historically had one of the better records in the industry for technological innovation and careful capital allocation, and they have been doubling down on this tendency lately. The rest of the industry is moving in that direction as well, after a disastrous 2010s decade.</p>
<h2>Enterprise Products Partners Analysis</h2>
<p>In addition to energy producers, I continue to like high-quality energy transporters, which are less subject to price and more subject to volumes. Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) is my favorite, although investors should be aware that it does issue a K-1 form, since it’s a MLP rather than a corporation. That means investors have to file an extra tax form during tax season.</p>

<p>The annual distribution yield is 8%, with 23 consecutive years of increases. They have a 1.6x distributable cash flow coverage ratio, and their most recent distribution increase was conservative at only 1.1% year-over-year as they deal with this uncertain time. They also do some opportunistic unit buybacks if they have spare capital after reinvestment and distributions.</p>
<p>They continue to trade at below-average valuations, with a distribution yield higher than its historical average, and a price-to-cashflow ratio that is below its historical average.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-epd-valuations.png" alt="EPD Valuations" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-epd-valuations.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-epd-valuations-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="430"></p>
<p>Their business is highly-diversified, as as they transport crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and petrochemicals. The majority of these products are used for purposes other than vehicle fuel, and thus are not easily displaced even with the growth trend of electric vehicles. They increasingly focus on exporting to various parts of Asia, where demand continues to grow strongly.</p>

<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EPD May 2021 Investor Deck</a></em></p>
<p>EPD recently reported that its volumes are rebounding from the pandemic lows, and that its ongoing growth projects are on-time and on-budget. Management has expressed on their most recent conference call that they think that supply shortages, combined with gradually growing demand, are likely to result in higher energy prices. And they’re looking out several years as they forecast these trends, not quarter by quarter.</p>
<p>They’ve also discussed long-term opportunities for repositioning their pipeline system expertise for carbon sequestration and/or hydrogen fuel transportation over time, but say that they still need more clarity on policy and the energy mix going forward.</p>
<p>In the meantime, they issue debt with a 4.5% average yield and a 20-year average duration, and use it to build assets that typically generate 12% returns on invested capital, while returning large amounts of cash to unitholders each year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-epd-assets-debt.png" alt="EPD Assets" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-epd-assets-debt.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-epd-assets-debt-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="430"></p>
<p>They maintain the highest credit rating in the midstream industry, tied with a few other blue chips in the industry, with low debt metrics relative to most peers. Their debt is fixed-rate, while their income streams on their various assets can generally go up with inflation. They no longer need to issue equity to fund growth, and if during any particular year growth opportunities are lackluster, they can instead use excess cash after distributions to buy back some of their units.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I continue to like some of the diversified health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, such as CVS Health (CVS) and Cigna (CI) as part of a portfolio.</p>
<p>In addition to being cheap, both of them are currently in the process of deleveraging from acquisitions (CVS for Aetna, and Cigna for Express Scripts), meaning that most cash flow is going into a combination of dividends, share reduction, and debt reduction. Here’s the net debt of both companies, where you can see the spikes where they made the acquisitions and the current consolidation process:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-net-debt.png" alt="Net Debt" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-net-debt.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-net-debt-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="430"></p>
<p>Cigna reported last week that, after low medical costs in 2020, they are facing some higher medical costs in 2021, and they had a sizable stock price drop on the news. This was despite the fact that the company beat consensus analyst expectations on revenue and earnings for past quarter, and provided guidance for the rest of the year that was in-line with consensus analyst expectations. In the grand scheme of things, it continues to be attractive, and sentiment has cooled off:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-ci-fastgraph.png" alt="CI FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-ci-fastgraph.png 968w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-ci-fastgraph-300x180.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-8-ci-fastgraph-768x462.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px" width="968" height="582"></p>

<p>Overall, I’m still viewing the second half of this year through a somewhat inflationary lens. The economy will inevitably weaken in rate-of-change terms due to base effects and stimulus wearing off, but inflation could very well be rather persistent. Consensus expectations among economists seem to be tilted towards disinflation, but rent inflation and wage inflation remain significant, even if things like lumber prices and used car prices have rolled over.</p>
<p>I like to have exposure to inflationary hedges in this environment, such as energy stocks, while also maintaining positions in some rather defensive assets like TIPS (STIP), gold, and a diverse basket of healthcare stocks (BMY, CVS, CI, etc). Some of the tech platforms continue to look attractive, like Facebook (FB), but it pays to be cautious about valuations in general.</p></div></article></main></div></div>
