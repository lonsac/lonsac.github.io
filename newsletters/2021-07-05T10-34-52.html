<p>This is a brief note between normal premium reports to make members aware that the 2021 Global Opportunities PDF Report is now available in the Google Drive, which you can access via the <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members area</a>.</p>
<p>It is the fourth and latest version of the report that comes out each summer. The purpose of the report is to analyze 30+ countries and find undervalued or overvalued opportunities, as well as various imbalances in the global macroeconomy to be aware of.</p>
<p>It gave me several new stock ideas that, upon further review, might start trickling into some of the model portfolios. It also helps give me some insights about where I want to tilt my global equity exposure, and how much overall risk there is in global equity markets in general. Valuations in most markets are a lot higher than this time last year, which at this point is of little surprise.</p>
<p>The reason I do this report is because if we look back historically, different equity regions tend to outperform for periods of time based on valuation reversals, dollar strength/weakness cycles, and other factors.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-international-performance.png" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-international-performance.png 598w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-international-performance-300x244.png 300w" alt="International Equities Performance" width="598" height="487"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source:&nbsp;iShares</em></p>
<p>In the 1980s, international developed markets (mainly Japan) outperformed. In the 1990s, the US outperformed. In the 2000s, emerging markets outperformed. In the 2010s, it was the US again. Looking back from 2030, which region will have been the star of the 2020s? I’m inclined to say emerging markets, although that’s a premise that we need to keep monitoring to see if it starts to become the case or not.</p>
<p>The report has an executive summary chart section in the beginning, and then dives into over 30 individual country specifics for those that want to go deeper. I’ll show some of the highlights here as well.</p>
<h2>2021 Highlights</h2>
<p>China, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Norway, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, and Taiwan came in with high scores this year, meaning their equity markets seem to offer attractive 5-year risk-adjusted forward return prospects.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, France, the Netherlands, and the United States came in near the bottom, indicating overvaluation or other issues.</p>
<p>But, each country does have various pros and cons. Here’s a look at the debt chart for example:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-debt.png" alt="Debt Levels" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-debt.png 412w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-debt-214x300.png 214w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" width="412" height="578"></p>
<p>There are always some caveats to make note of.</p>
<p>For example, Japan’s corporate net debt is actually very low, because in addition to high levels of absolute debt, Japanese corporations on average have massive cash balances.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/HorizonKinetics/status/1387051238223536139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Kinetics</a> analyzed Japanese equities this spring and publicizing some of their findings, and showed for example that Japanese corporate net debt/EBITDA went from 6x 25 years ago to about zero today, meaning on average they have about as much cash as they have debt:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-japanese-net-debt.jpg" alt="Japanese Net Debt" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-japanese-net-debt.jpg 680w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-japanese-net-debt-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" width="680" height="505"></p>
<p>In the United States, most companies (outside of the mega-cap tech names that have more cash than they know what to do with) don’t tend to hold enormous amounts of cash, but in Japan that is common for many companies to do these days, large and small.</p>
<p>Similarly, Singapore has a lot of debt, but also has sovereign wealth funds that together equal over 250% of GDP. In that sense, the government is a net creditor, not a net debtor.</p>
<p>Aside from unique situations like that, we can see that there are some very low-debt emerging markets like Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, and Russia, contrasted by some very high debt places in Europe.</p>
<p>We can also see how some markets are quite opposite of each other when it comes to debt. Italy has low household debt and high sovereign debt (and denominated in a currency they can’t print), while Australia has high household debt and low sovereign debt. Similarly, Turkey’s USD-denominated debt problem is within its corporate sector, while Argentina’s USD-denominated debt problem is in its government sector.</p>
<p>Speaking of Argentina and Turkey, one of the charts I like to update each year is the major emerging market dollar sensitivity chart. This chart shows the amount of dollar-denominated debts that some of the major emerging markets have as a percentage of their GDP compared to how much foreign-exchange reserves they have as a percentage of GDP:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-usd-denominated-debt.png" alt="EM Dollar Sensitivity Chart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-usd-denominated-debt.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-usd-denominated-debt-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="449"></p>
<p>Every few decades when the dollar goes through a big strengthening cycle, there is a series of emerging market crises. Basically, a bunch of developing countries take out dollar-based debts and if the dollar strengthens a lot compared to their home currency, they get wrecked. In the mid 1980s it hurt various countries in Latin America the most, in the late 1990s it hurt countries in southeast Asia and Russia the most, and in recent years it hurt places like Argentina and Turkey, as well as many frontier markets.</p>
<p>Some emerging markets like Malaysia have far more reserves than USD-debts during this cycle, which protects them from currency crises. Other markets like Turkey are a lot more exposed, and indeed they’re currently going through a currency crisis in part due to this situation (which may make for some nice investment opportunities when the dust starts to settle).</p>
<p><strong>Net International Investment Position</strong></p>
<p>I also like to monitor the net international investment position of various countries. This is a measure of how much foreign assets (stocks, bonds, and real estate) that their country owns (inclusive of both their government and private holders) minus how much of their country’s assets (stocks, bonds, and real estate) are owned by foreigners. It’s expressed here as a percentage of GDP:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-niip.png" alt="Net International Investment Position" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-niip.png 462w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-niip-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" width="462" height="326"></p>
<p>Positive net international investment positions are built up from years of current account surpluses.</p>
<p>Places like Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, and Taiwan have become massive creditor nations over time. They produced a lot more than they consumed for years and decades, collected a lot of dollars and other currencies, and used them to buy foreign assets. Some of these investments are held by their households and corporations, while others are held by massive sovereign wealth funds or pensions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some places like Australia, Mexico, the United States, Poland, Spain, and Turkey, ran structural current account deficits for a while and built up deeply negative net investment positions. For the United States in particular, foreign entities own large swaths of our equities, bond market, and real estate, since we have run persistent trade deficits for decades, and foreign entities take those dollars and buy our assets with them.</p>
<p>As a tangible example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/that-suburban-home-buyer-could-be-a-foreign-government-11618306380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the WSJ reported a few months ago</a>, over the past year it became popular for foreign institutional investors to buy single-family homes here in the United States and rent them back to Americans to earn income streams.</p>
<p><strong>Valuations</strong></p>
<p>Here’s chart of the current price/earnings and price/book ratios of various markets:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-equity-valuations.png" alt="Equity Valuations" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-equity-valuations.png 316w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-equity-valuations-143x300.png 143w" sizes="(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px" width="316" height="665"></p>
<p>It’s important to look at each market closely to normalize for sector differences. For example, the US has a lot of tech stocks, and so our equity markets tend to be higher-valued on average than Singapore, which heavily consists of bank in the large cap equity space. However, by looking at individual stocks and normalizing for sector differences, we can identify regions that are likely overvalued or undervalued.</p>
<p>For each market in the report, I also look at their market capitalization to GDP ratio. These can’t really be compared side-by-side either, since some countries are more financialized than others. However, looking at the multi-year trend can be helpful for finding markets that are cheaper or more expensive than their historical average.</p>
<p>The Chinese market, for example, is below its 2007 bubble peak valuation level, but moderately above its average historical valuation, which is interesting, given the fact that a lot of technology exposure was added to its index compared to ten or twenty years ago. Meanwhile the US market is at record high valuations based on this metric compared to its historical average, and is rather expensive even when taking into account high levels of tech exposure.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-us-vs-china-1.png" alt="US vs China Valuations" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-us-vs-china-1.png 580w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-5-us-vs-china-1-236x300.png 236w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" width="580" height="737"></p>
<p>The full global report is available in the Google Drive, so I recommend giving it a skim through. The next regular premium report will come out this upcoming Sunday as normal.</p>
