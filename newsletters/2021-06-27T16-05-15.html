      <p dir="ltr">When I find myself getting stressed or burned out, I usually notice a common trend. I'm spending <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=56598a85bb&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">too much time on my phone</a>, not enough time reading...in the evenings most of all. I heard a good rule recently related to this: At the end of the day, when you're fried and feel like you can't do anything but sit there and watch TV (or scroll on social), you know what you should do? You should go to bed. You're tired! Go to sleep! I would just add to that that a few minutes of reading before you shut off the lights can be the perfect part of the transition. <br/>
        <br/>
        Anyway, here we go with this month's recommendations, including some favorites we are carrying at my book store <strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=55314e959e&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Painted Porch</a></strong> (which you're all invited to anytime you're in Texas and of course, online). Thanks for your patience as we fulfill these early orders by the way. Your support means a lot. </p>

        <br/>
        I first read Omar El Akkad's <em><strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=7b5e3827cf&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">American War: A Novel</a></strong> </em>back in 2016 and its haunting, prescient imagination of a future American Civil War will sober you right up. Same goes for <strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=8ec9f39828&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">It Can't Happen Here</a></em></strong> by Sinclair Lewis in 1935. Stop messing around people. This stuff is serious. On a relatedly serious note, I had the incredible honor of <strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=94c247cd3e&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">interviewing Dr. Edith Eger</a></strong>, a 93-year-old Holocaust survivor who later studied under Dr. Viktor Frankl. Dr. Eger's book <em><strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=2f8e6e5307&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Choice: Embrace The Possible</a></strong> </em>is a MUST read (as is <strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=c4e7b33152&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Man's Search for Meaning</a></em></strong>). We all have a choice about how we respond to what happens to us in life—we can choose to be heroic. On a more entertaining note, <strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=78af6eff6f&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo</a></em></strong> by Tom Reiss is an amazing narrative about the incredible life of Alexandre Dumas' father, a black general in Napoleon's army. And of course, <strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=b5d4bb4411&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">A Confederacy of Dunces</a></em></strong> by John Kennedy Toole is always popular in the store because, seriously, it is possibly the funniest book ever written.

        <br/>
        The blurb on the back of this book is "I would read an 800 page history of the stapler if it was by Michael Lewis." That about sums it up. As always, Michael Lewis finds the story behind the story, the unusual characters driving the history of the moment—in this case, of the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Great book. A must read alongside <em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=20bb32322d&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Great Influenza</a></em>. Seriously people, get vaccinated! Especially now with the delta variant. Also, my condolences to the tragedy that befell Michael Lewis' family recently. It is always terribly sad when someone who has created so much happiness for others is dealt a cruel blow by fate. </p>

        <br/>
        I was lucky enough to help Chris bring this book into existence. Obviously, I am biased but I think this is a book that very much needs to exist and Chris is a wonderful thinker and philosopher about sports, craft, the drive to win and responding to adversity. <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=4ef60ec240&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">You can listen to my interview with him</a> (<a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=03344d87e8&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">recorded at the front table at the bookstore</a>) here, but do read the book.

        <br/>
        I've never read a Sebastian Junger book that I felt could be any shorter. He gets right down to the essence of things and adds not one word more. This is a book about his long walks across the eastern United States and the musings it brought up about freedom, society, obligation and community. I also highly recommend his book <em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=edaf7d8863&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging</a></em>. <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=bb5bfaec33&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">You can listen to my episode with Sebastian here as well.</a> </p>

Some of the books didn't treat him kindly, but I found him a much more impressive figure in his own way. His autobiography is perfectly titled as well. Isn't that what we're all trying to do? Isn't that real greatness? Anyway, it was fun reading this forgotten biography, and he is now a hero of mine. First heavyweight champion to regain the title after losing it. </p>

Whether you buy them at The Painted Porch or on Amazon today, or at your nearest independent bookstore six months from now makes no difference to me. I just hope you read!<br/>
          <br/>
          You’re welcome to email me questions or raise issues for discussion. Better yet, if you know of a good book on a related topic, please pass it along. And as always, if one of these books comes to mean something to you, recommend it to someone else.<br/>
          <br/>
          I promised myself a long time ago that if I saw a book that interested me I’d never let time or money or anything else prevent me from having it. This means that I treat reading with a certain amount of respect. All I ask, if you decide to email me back, is that you’re not just thinking aloud.<br/>
          <br/>
          Enjoy these books, treat your education like the job that it is, and let me know if you ever need anything.<br/>
