<p>This report covers macro conditions, currencies, rates, gold, recent bitcoin volatility, and problems building up in the repo market. It then provides an update for Scotiabank and the broader value stock segment of the market.</p>
<h2>Macro View</h2>
<p>US COVID-19 hospitalizations have remained quite low in recent weeks, fueling the re-opening theme:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-hospitalizations.png" alt="Hospitalizations" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-hospitalizations.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-hospitalizations-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="400"></p>
<p>The recent hot spot, India, has decisively rolled over in terms of daily case counts:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-india-covid.png" alt="India COVID" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-india-covid.png 707w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-india-covid-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" width="707" height="454"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Worldometer</em></p>
<p>Japan has also shown signs of rolling over their daily case count:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-japan-covid.png" alt="Japan COVID" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-japan-covid.png 710w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-japan-covid-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" width="710" height="454"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Worldometer</em></p>
<p>A majority of Japan’s population spent the last several weeks in partial lockdowns/curfews, in what has been the country’s third state of emergency since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020. So, that has been weighing on Japanese value stocks a bit, even though the long-term outlook remains robust.</p>
<p><strong>Latest Market Issue: Too Much QE?</strong></p>
<p>With quantitative easing, the Fed creates new base money and uses it to buy assets from banks. Banks can then multiply those bank reserves by lending (thus increasing the financial system’s money multiple, broad money as a ratio of broad money), or just sit on them.</p>
<p>This quantitative easing process stuffs banks full of liquidity, but then along with various rules that are placed on the financial system including the supplementary leverage ratio, there can be such a thing as too much liquidity.</p>
<p>So in recent months, as SLR exemptions expired and quantitative easing continued, the Federal Reserve began doing an increasing amount of daily reverse repurchase agreements to soak up some of the overflowing liquidity that they’ve put into the system:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-reverse-repos.png" alt="Reverse Repos" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-reverse-repos.png 664w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-reverse-repos-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" width="664" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>In other words, there are tons of bank reserves in the system from all of this quantitative easing and banks are parking the spillover at the Fed with reverse repos. It’s precisely the <em>opposite</em> problem of the September 2019 repo rate spike, when there were too many T-bills and not enough reserves.</p>
<p>If we zoom out, this chart shows bank cash as a % of total bank assets vs the Fed’s daily reverse repo operations:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bank-cash-levels-vs-repos.png" alt="Bank Cash Levels vs Repos" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bank-cash-levels-vs-repos.png 664w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bank-cash-levels-vs-repos-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" width="664" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>As the chart shows, the Fed first ran into this issue back in 2014, when they did their final round of quantitative easing for that cycle. Banks hit record high cash levels as a percentage of assets and the Fed had to take some of that excess liquidity off their hands with reverse repos. There was a brief burst of reverse repo activity in March 2020, but everything was crazy then so that was for a different reason. Since April 2021, this issue is repeating on a more sustained basis, similar to 2014.</p>
<p>The Fed has a few options. They can reverse course and renew the SLR exemptions that they let expire, they can tweak the IOER rate or reverse repo rate or other levers by several basis points, they can taper quantitative easing starting with mortgage-backed securities and shift their purchases to the long end of the Treasury market, or they can just keep doing massive reverse repos.</p>
<p>They’re already starting to slightly increase the duration of their Treasury purchases, and there are growing signs/talks of the Fed shifting towards broadening access to the repo and reverse repo facilities at the Fed and making them more permanent.</p>
<p><strong>Interest Rates, Inflation, Gold, and the Dollar</strong></p>
<p>Inflation expectations as measured by the TIPS market continue to inch upward but corrected a bit in recent days, while the 10-year nominal Treasury rate has been in a more notable consolidation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-inflation-and-rates.png" alt="Inflation and Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-inflation-and-rates.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-inflation-and-rates-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>The 4.16% year-over-year CPI number in the chart above is for April, which was reported in mid-May. The May year-over-year CPI figure, which will be reported in June, will most likely be over 4.5%, and it wouldn’t be shocking to see it over 5%.</p>
<p>A significant component of the CPI rise over the past few months was due to used vehicle prices shooting up thanks in part to semiconductor shortages, and the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index has shown continued price increases from April into mid-May:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-used-car-prices.png" alt="Used Car Prices" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-used-car-prices.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-used-car-prices-282x300.png 282w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="744"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://publish.manheim.com/en/services/consulting/used-vehicle-value-index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manheim</a></em></p>
<p>After May however, inflation becomes less clear. Many commodity prices, ranging from lumber to iron to copper to wheat to soybeans peaked in mid-May and lately have been correcting. Here’s iron for example:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-iron.png" alt="Iron Prices" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-iron.png 746w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-iron-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" width="746" height="468"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Trading Economics</em></p>
<p>Beyond that, I like Nordea’s inflation model a lot. In year-over-year terms, most signs currently point toward a spike to mid-single-digit inflation during the next few months and then a cool-off period at elevated levels for the remainder of the year:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/newsletter-2021-5-cpi-trend-model.png" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/newsletter-2021-5-cpi-trend-model.png 754w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/newsletter-2021-5-cpi-trend-model-300x188.png 300w" alt="Nordea CPI Trend Model" width="754" height="473"></p>

<p>Projecting beyond that becomes increasingly challenging, because it will depend on how wages respond, and the timing and magnitude of future federal infrastructure/stimulus programs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dollar continues to weaken gradually, but still hasn’t broken the final support levels and thus is not “interesting” yet:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-dxy.png" alt="Dollar Index" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-dxy.png 746w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-dxy-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" width="746" height="468"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Trading Economics</em></p>
<p>The biggest weight in the dollar index basket is the euro. If the euro breaks over $1.235 USD, it’ll hit new 52-week highs. If it breaks firmly over $1.25, then it’ll clear out the 2018 highs, and move over all recent resistance going back many years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-eurusd.png" alt="EURUSD" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-eurusd.png 746w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-eurusd-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" width="746" height="468"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Trading Economics</em></p>
<p>The structural forces for a weaker dollar are 1) the bigger US twin deficit compared to other developed countries and 2) the faster broad money supply growth from the fiscal deficit. Shorter-term, this translated into the fact that the US has lower real (aka inflation-adjusted) interest rates than most developed peers. Our nominal rates are generally higher than their nominal rates, but because we did more fiscal stimulus and have faster broad money growth, we have higher inflation, and the net result is lower real interest rates at the moment.</p>
<p>The biggest risk I see for this ongoing dollar bearish view, at least in the intermediate-term, would be a surprise fast-taper of quantitative easing by the Fed in response to the aforementioned reverse repo problem. The last time this reverse repo problem happened back in 2014, the Fed stopped quantitative easing and the dollar index shot straight up. That led to emerging market crises, the oil price decline, and a near-recession in the United States. However, I don’t think the Fed is willing to let that happen this time around, at least at this stage of the cycle, and they are capable of making other tweaks to keep quantitative easing in place. It does, however, remain an important sharp unwind risk to monitor.</p>
<p>Gold and gold miners continue to show considerable strength since bottoming in March 2021. And as usual, gold is mainly inversely following real interest rates (10 year Treasury rates minus 10-year inflation breakevens). However, this past week started to see a mild rise in real yields, which gold shrugged off:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-gold-vs-real-rates.png" alt="Gold vs Real Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-gold-vs-real-rates.png 664w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-gold-vs-real-rates-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" width="664" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>With commodity prices rolling over, inflation breakevens have relaxed a bit, so real yields have moved up slightly. However, another strong CPI print for May (reported in mid-June) could shake up inflation expectations again.</p>
<p>One of the biggest unanswered questions in markets today is what will happen with inflation over the next several months, and what levels or durations of inflation would lead the Fed to try to tighten earlier than they previously indicated. The growing usage of reverse repo operations adds a second layer of uncertainty to that as well.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that the spike in US personal income from the third round of stimulus checks is wearing off. There are still stimulatory effects including expanded child tax credits and extended unemployment benefits that will continue for many months, but in rate of change terms, the fiscal shot of adrenaline into the market is more behind us than ahead of us. This chart of personal income only goes through the end of March, which was reported in late April. I added some lines:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-personal-income.png" alt="Personal Income" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-personal-income.png 680w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-personal-income-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" width="680" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>My overall base case, as described in my public <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/may-2021-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May newsletter</a>, is that I’m taking the “under” on Fed policy tightening, at least in terms of interest rates. They may taper asset purchases due to the reverse repo issue (starting with mortgage-backed securities), but I don’t expect rate hikes to come quickly in response to inflationary spikes, and the Fed has said as much. They might tweak IOER rates or similar levers by some basis points to maintain their effective policy rate, but are unlikely to materially raise rates in response to inflation this year or next.</p>
<p>The Fed will dismiss inflationary spikes as transitory and related to supply chain problems, which is partially correct, at least in rate of change terms. In reality, the sharp increase in broad money supply contributed to these supply/demand issues and has been inflationary for prices, but COVID-19 and the proximate supply chain issues give the Fed a significant amount of cover to under-hike rates.</p>
<p>However, we still don’t know the high water mark for what year-over-year CPI and/or core PCE will reach, or how persistent the inflation will be from wage pressure and other variables after September 2021 when the extra unemployment benefits across the country are set to dry up.</p>
<p>From there, whether we get further inflation spikes after this spring/summer spike, will depend on further fiscal policy actions, as well as how tight the oil market gets by the middle of this decade. I continue to expect the 2020s decade to be overall more inflationary than the 2010s, but it will not be in a straight line.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Note</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has been exceedingly volatile lately, and other cryptos have been even more volatile. I sent out a <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/premium-2021-5-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volatility/risk note on May 16</a>, indicating that I remain long-term bullish on bitcoin but with lack of clarity on intermediate-term price direction, along with a general portfolio-wide suggestion to check risk levels.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-btcusd-chart.png" alt="BTCUSD Chart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-btcusd-chart.png 697w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-btcusd-chart-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" width="697" height="377"></p>
<p>On May 19, after an already-declining technical pattern, Bitcoin suddenly crashed from about $45k to $30k briefly, liquidating billions of dollars worth of leveraged positions, before shooting back up to over $40k. It has since bounced around in a big range from the low-$40ks down to the low-$30ks.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/bitcoin-historical-corrections-from-all-time-highs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Capitalist showed</a>, this decline from its all-time high of $64k in April to briefly $30k on May 19, was the sixth biggest correction in percent terms in the history of the protocol:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bitcoin-corrections.jpg" alt="VC Bitcoin Corrections" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bitcoin-corrections.jpg 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bitcoin-corrections-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bitcoin-corrections-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="700"></p>
<p>In many ways, it was a perfect storm for bitcoin. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) stopped buying bitcoin in February, retail investors became increasingly interested in altcoins (as is common during the heart of post-halving bitcoin bull run), Tesla shifted its position about bitcoin’s green-ness, and bitcoin price action is historically weak in the weeks leading up to the US annual tax deadline (which was pushed to May 17 this year). Then after the crash when bitcoin recovered to over $40k, the US Treasury <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/20/us-treasury-calls-for-stricter-cryptocurrency-compliance-with-irs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced plans</a> to monitor large bitcoin transactions to ensure tax compliance and China <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/bitcoin-falls-after-china-calls-for-crackdown-on-bitcoin-mining-and-trading-behavior.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called for a crackdown</a> on bitcoin mining and trading.</p>
<p>For context, China has ineffectively “banned” bitcoin on multiple occasions going back to 2013 (and yet it is still mined and traded there), and has effectively banned most US social media platforms, US search engines, and US payment systems.</p>
<p>However, it’s possible that this one will be more enforced than previous China bitcoin bans. There are some folks in the bitcoin community that have said for years that they wouldn’t mind seeing an actual bitcoin ban in China (unlike their previous multiple “bans” that never panned out), because it would shift the hash rate out of China and towards other countries, and would reduce coal usage in bitcoin mining operations. That would eliminate some of the longstanding criticisms of the protocol- the fact that China is the largest hash rate country, and that a sizable chunk of the hash rate there is from coal.</p>
<p>Nic Carter, the first crypto analyst at Fidelity, co-founder of a blockchain analytics firm, and current partner at a blockchain VC firm, has been discussing some observations on hash rate movements:</p>

<p>One of the largest bitcoin miners in China had similar observations:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-mustafa-yilham-tweet.png" alt="Mustafa Yilham Tweet" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-mustafa-yilham-tweet.png 611w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-mustafa-yilham-tweet-203x300.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" width="611" height="903"></p>
<p>This sharp bitcoin and altcoin price correction hurts leveraged traders, hurts low-conviction late investors who bought during the past few months and panic-sold during the price drop, and partially hurts the hardcore bitcoiners who are 100% invested in bitcoin and are experiencing massive volatility.</p>
<p>However, for investors who use unleveraged bitcoin as part of their diversified portfolio (as per my approach), it’s not a huge deal.</p>
<p>For example, my cold storage bitcoin cost basis, from initiating my position at $7k in April 2020 and dollar-cost averaging throughout the rest of the year to complete my position, is around $15k. Withstanding a crash from over 4x your cost basis to 2x your cost basis, and only as part of your portfolio, is easier than withstanding a crash if you initially bought in during this quarter with too big of a position for comfort and are underwater.</p>
<p>The price structure of this entire post-halving bitcoin bull market is now in question, and as of now it looks a lot like the two-phase 2013 bull run. Either way, I remain bullish on the long-term network effects of the protocol, unless I see data that suggest otherwise. In particular, NYDIG’s plans to partner with banks to make bitcoin available in US bank accounts and to link bitcoin with more credit card reward programs, is a strong network effect component that looks like it’s coming in late 2021 or early 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding GBTC’s Impact</strong></p>
<p>In my view, the biggest negative variable for bitcoin’s rolling-over price action over the past four months is the fact that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) completely stopped buying bitcoin since February 2021. That weakened the underlying bullish price support, which allowed other headlines like Elon Musk’s tweets to shake price action pretty severely.</p>
<p>GBTC, as a publicly-traded trust that buys and stores bitcoin, was previously the biggest bitcoin buyer in the world. It accumulated 260,000+ bitcoin from July 2020 through the end of January 2021, up to a grand total of over 650,000 bitcoin.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-grayscale-bitcoin-bybt.png" alt="Grayscale Bitcoin Holdings" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-grayscale-bitcoin-bybt.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-grayscale-bitcoin-bybt-300x132.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="307"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bybt</a></em></p>
<p>The reason GBTC stopped buying is that the premium over net asset value for the trust turned into a discount vs net asset value:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-gbtc-discount.png" alt="GBTC Discount" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-gbtc-discount.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-gbtc-discount-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="400"></p>
<p>This discount doesn’t cause any internal risk to GBTC, but it completely stops them from growing and buying more bitcoin.</p>
<p>Previously, there were two types of buyers of GBTC. One type of buyer simply consisted of people that were bullish on bitcoin, and wanted to hold it in a brokerage account or in an investment fund which GBTC was useful for. The second type of buyer consisted of people that had no particular view on bitcoin’s price action, but wanted to arbitrage GBTC’s premium over NAV.</p>
<p>Let’s examine the second type of GBTC buyer, since that is what disappeared since February. The way GBTC works, is that accredited investors can contribute new capital, GBTC accumulates bitcoin with it, and those investors are issued new GBTC shares at NAV. This is a good deal, because GBTC almost always historically traded at a premium over NAV in public markets, so they got to buy GBTC shares below market rates directly from the trust at NAV. However, in exchange for that special placement, they have a six-month lockup period. After six months, they can sell their GBTC shares at market prices.</p>
<p>So, many investors and funds arbitraged that. They bought into GBTC at NAV (thereby putting more bitcoin into the trust), and then shorted an equal amount of bitcoin elsewhere, so they were neutral on bitcoin and long only the premium over NAV. After six months, they sold GBTC at market prices (capturing that premium over their cost basis at NAV) and closed their bitcoin short. Their gains for that period were whatever the premium over NAV was at the time of sale. This was often like 10-30% or more, and they could do it every six months, for really high risk-free returns (except the tail risk of counterparty problems). Since GBTC shares are not redeemable for bitcoin, once new shares are created, the bitcoin remain in GBTC after the trade is done. Every time investors did this trade, they permanently added more bitcoin to the trust. Their bitcoin shorts were temporary, but the bitcoin they added to the trust stayed there permanently.</p>
<p>So, GBTC served as big honey pot or “Hotel California” for converting liquid bitcoin on exchanges into illiquid cold-storage bitcoin, with no reverse route possible. As long as the arbitrage existed, GBTC just kept sucking up tons of bitcoin, at times buying bitcoin at a faster rate than bitcoin was mined, and thus draining bitcoin from exchanges.</p>
<p>Once this premium turned into a discount, there is no reason for investors to work with GBTC to make new shares, and thus GBTC stopped buying bitcoin. In fact, as long as the discount remains negative, they will be selling about 2% of their bitcoin (approximately 13,000 bitcoin) per year to pay expenses, so it’ll very gradually diminish.</p>
<p>In my view, the likely reason for GBTC’s premium going away, is that there is a lot of new competition now and GBTC’s fees are too high. It’s easier than it used to be to buy bitcoin directly on exchanges, so more people do that now. The Skybridge Bitcoin Fund, launched in early 2021, has half of the expense ratio that GBTC has. Custodians like NYDIG and Fidelity do business directly with institutional capital that want an allocation. GBTC’s discount to NAV is basically the market adjusting for the fact that its fees are too high. This is common among closed-end equity funds.</p>
<p>The net result is that the GBTC bitcoin-neutral premium arbitrage dried up, and that was a big source of bitcoin demand, so that factor going away wasn’t good for bitcoin’s price in the intermediate term. On the other hand, GBTC is a better bitcoin exposure vehicle for retail investors than it used to be, since it trades at a discount to NAV rather than a premium. If it is ever allowed by the SEC to convert to an ETF, investors would benefit from the discount going away. Of course, the usefulness of GBTC is still tied to whether an investor is bullish on the underlying bitcoin or not, and over what time period.</p>
<p>Grayscale has no inherent problems remaining at a discount to NAV indefinitely. However, as long as it does, it won’t grow its number of bitcoin, and it will sell approximately 2% of its bitcoin per year to cover fees. Whenever it or another fund gets the green light by the SEC to become an ETF, that represents another potential source of demand, as it will become very easy for many types of investors (including RIAs) to buy bitcoin in a highly liquid vehicle (more-so than the current trust, which trades over the counter). In the meantime, GBTC is good for folks who want bitcoin exposure in their IRA or other brokerage account. M1 Finance can’t hold it since it trades over the counter, but Fidelity, Schwab, and Interactive Brokers for example can hold it with no problem.</p>
<p>For the No Limits portfolio, as a recap for people that are following those pre-announced trades, I started with 500 shares of GBTC at a cost basis of less than $10 at the end of June 2020, for a slightly less than $5k total investment. I sold 100 shares when GBTC hit about $30 in December, and sold another 100 shares when GBTC hit $50 in February (where it briefly had a 40% premium over NAV). So, I took out about $8k, which equals the entire $5k cost basis plus 60% gains ($3k), and am letting the other 300 shares (currently worth $9k) run for now.</p>

<h2>Portfolio Updates</h2>
<p>I consider the portfolios to be well-positioned for the current environment and haven’t made many changes lately. There are a few small changes for this week.</p>
<p>The full portfolios can be viewed in my Google Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Top 12 List</strong></p>
<p>-Replace Amgen (AMGN) with Scotiabank (BNS). I like Amgen and remain long in multiple portfolios, but their drug pipeline has not been particularly inspiring lately and there are no strong catalysts at the moment for it to be in the top 12.</p>
<p>-Replace Enbridge (ENB) with Enterprise Products Partners (EPD). I like Enbridge and remain long in multiple portfolios, but Enterprise is my overall favorite midstream business. Because it issues a K-1 form, I don’t have it in any of the model portfolios, although I do have a sizable position listed in my Other Holdings tab and have highlighted it in a few premium reports. To better highlight this business, I determined that the Top 12 list is a good place for it.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletter Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-Decrease the dividend stock pie from 26% to 25%. Increase SHY from 5% to 6%.</p>
<p>-Decrease the growth stock pie from 11% to 10%. Increase the commodity producer pie from 12% to 13%.</p>
<p>-Add an 8% position to Exxon Mobil (XOM) to the commodity producer pie. Reduce each gold and silver stock by 1% to accommodate the addition. With the increase in the size of the commodity pie minus the addition of XOM, the gold/silver stock allocation as a percentage of the total portfolio is basically unchanged, even though it went down as a share of the commodity pie.</p>
<p><strong>Fortress Income</strong></p>
<p>-Increase KMI from 3% to 4%, and decrease AMGN from 4% to 3%, in the individual stock pie.</p>
<p><strong>ETF-Only Portfolios</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>No Limits Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-Buy 50 shares of the iShares Global Energy ETF (IXC).</p>
<p><strong>Other Holdings</strong></p>
<p>-Buy more Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY). It’s super cheap, the acquisition digestion is going well, and the price action is pointing up. I covered this in my recent <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/premium-2021-4-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 25, 2021 report</a> and it looks good with a 3-5 year view.</p>

<h2>Scotiabank Update</h2>
<p>I most recently recommended the Bank of Nova Scotia or “Scotiabank” (BNS) in a <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/premium-2020-11-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 22, 2020 report</a>, and I think we’re due for an update here. An update with this one also helps us dig into what’s happening with financial stocks and value equities broadly.</p>
<p>Since that November report, we’ve had a big uptick in Scotiabank stock, which brings up the reasonable question of whether it’s too hot now:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-ychart.png" alt="BNS YChart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-ychart.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-ychart-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="416"></p>
<p>However, when we zoom out, it’s still in a big sideways consolidation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-fastgraph.png" alt="BNS FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-fastgraph.png 971w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-fastgraph-300x182.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-fastgraph-768x466.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px" width="971" height="589"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>That chart is for the Canadian dollar version, but whether in US dollars or Canadian dollars, it’s pretty similar. The stock is trading at less than 11x analyst-consensus 2021 earnings, with a 4.5% dividend. I wouldn’t call that overheated yet, when talking about a long-term dividend stock holding.</p>
<p>The stock remains mildly below-average in terms of valuation, despite the recent euphoria in risk assets more broadly. The dividend yield is above-average, the cyclically-adjusted price/earnings ratio is below average, and the price/book is below average:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-valuation.png" alt="BNS Valuation" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-valuation.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-valuation-300x213.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="461"></p>
<p>And this chart shows Scotiabank’s dividend yield minus Canada’s 10-year government bond yield:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-yield-differential.png" alt="BNS Yield Differential" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-yield-differential.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-bns-yield-differential-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="418"></p>
<p>Decades ago, government bonds had a much higher yield. Scotiabank had a lower yield, in exchange for more growth. Now, you get almost 3% more yield by being willing to hold Scotiabank, and historically it grows the dividend in most years as well.</p>
<p>So, when everyone is talking about an overvalued market, it really only refers to growth stocks in the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. In contrast, there are plenty of boring companies trading at below-average valuations around the world, but they are often things like banks and energy pipelines that underperformed over the past decade and few people want to touch.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Scotiabank is doing pretty good. Their loan losses are well-provisioned, and they continue to increase their rate of mobile app usage among customers, adapting well to modern banking trends. They have diverse retail and business banking relationships, and are active among multiples lines of business. Importantly, unlike Europe and Japan, Canada and the Latin American markets that Scotiabank operates in have positive yield curves.</p>
<p><strong>More Broadly: Value vs Growth</strong></p>
<p>This chart shows the MSCI ACWI value index vs the MSCI ACWI growth index. Whenever it goes up, it means value stocks are globally outperforming growth stocks, and whenever it goes down, it means growth stocks are outperforming:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-acwi-value-growth.png" alt="Value vs Growth" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-acwi-value-growth.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-acwi-value-growth-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="418"></p>
<p>Looking back historically longer-term, periods of higher inflation correspond to value stocks generally outperforming growth stocks. This was true in the 1940s, the 1970s, and the 2000s. On the value side, commodity producers benefit from higher prices and banks benefit from positive yield curves. On the growth side, the growth/tech companies do fine fundamentally, but their valuations get pressured from higher inflation and higher long-end interest rates.</p>
<p>As an example of the type of growth stocks that are on the other side of that growth-to-value rotation, we can see examples like Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) that rolled over but are still very pricey by historical standards:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-cdns-fastgraph.png" alt="CDNS FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-cdns-fastgraph.png 971w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-cdns-fastgraph-300x182.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-23-cdns-fastgraph-768x466.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px" width="971" height="589"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>Basically, companies like Cadence are great in terms of underlying fundamentals, but became quite overheated in terms of valuation in 2020. Cadence trades at a forward estimated price/earnings/growth ratio (“PEG ratio”) of 4x. And despite being a mature company, it still doesn’t pay a dividend.</p>
<p>While there are select growth stocks I own and would buy on corrections, I continue to prefer a value tilt at this time. There are plenty of good companies in the healthcare sector, financial sector, and energy sector that remain at below-average valuations despite in many cases having improved their underlying quality in a difficult disinflationary environment over the past several years.</p>
<p><strong>Scotiabank Risks</strong></p>
<p>Scotiabank has a variety of risks, in line with the rest of the global banking sector.</p>
<p><em>Credit Risk</em></p>
<p>The global banking system still faces considerable uncertainty. As governments taper stimulus, banks could face more headwinds. However, I think that there is a feedback function here; any slowness of growth and return of disinflation and solvency problems, has a good chance of stirring up another round of fiscal support. At this stage of the long-term debt cycle with rising populism, policymakers have a tight response time towards economic issues.</p>
<p>Scotiabank has exposure to Canada’s expensive housing market, but less-so than some of their rival banks which is why it is my preferred Canadian bank. Instead, Scotiabank has diversified into Latin America via Mexico, Chile, Peru, and Columbia. That’s a combination that I like quite a bit because it gives investors curated emerging market exposure through a developed market bank.</p>
<p><em>Interest Rate Risk</em></p>
<p>One of the biggest risks for banks around the world is interest rate risk. Unlike credit risk which hits hard and fast, interest rate risk slowly bleeds the banks of profitability over time. Banks don’t do well in zero-rate or negative-rate environments, and tend to prefer steeper yield curves. European and Japanese banks have been absolutely crushed by low rate policy for decades now.</p>
<p>Canada and the United States offer better prospects for this than their European and Japanese peers. Scotiabank further distributes their risk by having exposure to emerging markets that generally have higher inflation and higher rates, in exchange for more volatility and credit risk.</p>
<p>At this time, I like gold as a hedge for interest rate risk. The gold price is strongly inversely correlated to real yields. Gold does better if real rates stay low. Banks do better if nominal yields go up and the yield curve has a positive slope. If inflation runs hot and the yield curve remains steep but below the inflation rate (my base case for the time being), then both gold and banks can do well.</p>
<p><em>Currency Risk</em></p>
<p>Scotiabank operates in multiple countries and has broad currency exposure. In addition, non-Canadian investors have considerable exchange rate risk between their local currency and the Canadian currency. This goes the other way as well; if the Canadian currency outperforms their local currency, it can create a positive tailwind.</p>
<p>Canada’s currency will in part be tied to energy prices and commodity prices more broadly, due to the Canadian economy’s heavy exposure to those industries. With low energy prices, Canada has a trade deficit, which puts downward pressure on the currency. With high energy prices, Canada could go back to having a trade surplus, which puts upward pressure on the currency.</p>
<p>I don’t have a strong view on the Canadian currency over the next year, but I am bullish on commodities for the 2020s decade.</p>
<p><em>Disruption Risk</em></p>
<p>Investors are concerned with all sorts of disruptive risks for established bank companies. Fintech companies ranging from PayPal to smaller peers have made payments easier, and now cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance applications can further disrupt established banking channels. And then on top of that, some investors are worried about the prospect for central bank digital currencies to go around the commercial banking system and compete with them.</p>
<p>This is why I prefer to focus on some of the more digitally-savvy banks. I particularly like Sberbank of Russia (SBRCY), which has extremely high mobile adoption, invests in tech companies, and has already tested blockchain applications. Similarly, I like HDFC Bank of India (HDB), Discover Financial Services (DFS), American Express (AXP), J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM), Scotiabank (BNS), and the top banks of Singapore like DBS Holdings (DBSDY).</p>
<p>A simple way to hedge these disruptive risks is to have a nonzero Bitcoin position. I like the banks+gold+bitcoin combo at this time, within a diversified portfolio. If decentralized finance and tokenization massively disrupts the profitability of established banks quicker than almost anyone expects (rather than those banks gradually adopting to the tech as needed, which firms like NYDIG are helping to make happen), then bitcoin is an asymmetric play on that outcome. If banks continue to do reasonably well from beaten-down valuation levels, then they can continue to be solid dividend payers and participate in a potential growth-to-value equity rotation in the context of a cyclical recovery.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The market is still partying, and there are plenty of good value stocks out there, but there are storm clouds on the horizon. The music already winded down in terms of SPACs, unprofitable hyper-growth stocks, lumber, and crypto/altcoins. I tactically like healthcare stocks, gold stocks, energy pipelines, high-quality energy producers, and financials at this time, among a collection of stocks from other industries as well.</p>
<p>The US government will probably pass an infrastructure bill at some point this year or next (but currently it is hotly divided in Congress and thus not certain), and there are still effects from the latest bill extending through the rest of this year, but the quick-acting parts of the fiscal stimulus bills are behind us. Consumer price inflation in year-over-year terms, at least for this particular burst of it, will likely peak in late spring or the summer.</p>
<p>Many signs point dollar-bearish (which is good for most risk assets), and I continue to be a long-term dollar bear since October 2019 when DXY was 99. However, the growing reverse repo problem might lead the Fed to taper asset purchases sooner than they planned, unless they want to revisit the SLR exemption for US banks or establish more permanent overnight facilities. If quantitative easing tapers faster than the market expects, it could result in a dollar spike, which would put pressure on the US and global economy. That’s not my base case but it’s a risk to monitor.</p>
<p>Due to the increasingly problematic <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structure of the global monetary system</a>, there is a ton of US-denominated debt in the world, with much of it owed to China, Europe, and Japan. Whenever the dollar tightens, the world encounters economic problems. And because the world is so interconnected, those problems come back to negatively affect the United States as well. Plus, the problem keeps growing, which makes the effect stronger in each cycle. It’ll be very challenging to get an ongoing reflationary cycle beyond 2021 unless the dollar has another significant down move vs other currencies:</p>

<p>Basically, we should be prepared for volatility, since inflation and currency moves won’t occur in a straight line, and there are still obstacles in the way of the longer-term outcome such as the SLR rules and reverse repo issues in the United States. I remain structurally inflationary and dollar-bearish for the next several years, but am watching the situation with reverse repos closely for any sharp changes in monetary policy that could arise from it.</p>
<p>It’s important to know what you own in this environment, which is why I like to analyze the underlying business fundamentals and valuations of equities I own.</p>
