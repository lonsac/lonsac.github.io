<p>The macro portion of this report provides an update on the virus, US retail sales, China, gold, the dollar, and supply chain issues.</p>
<p>It then moves onto an update on Bitcoin and Ethereum, and then dives into CVS Health, a value stock that is strengthening its balance sheet and shifting some of its retail space to medical clinic space.</p>
<p>As a housekeeping note, I just published a&nbsp;public article on <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin’s energy consumption</a>.</p>
<h2>Macro View</h2>
<p>There are early signs that the delta variant wave is peaking in global terms, although it varies country-by-country:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-global-covid.png" alt="Global COVID-19" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-global-covid.png 621w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-global-covid-204x300.png 204w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" width="621" height="913"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldometer</a></em></p>
<p>I’m closely watching data from Malaysia and the rest of the southeast Asia, which has been hit hard and early by the wave. Indonesia already firmly peaked a while ago, and Malaysia looks like it is getting close:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-malaysia-covid.png" alt="Malaysia COVID-19" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-malaysia-covid.png 641w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-malaysia-covid-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" width="641" height="844"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Worldometer</em></p>
<p><em>Our World in Data</em> has a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/biweekly-growth-covid-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful interactive map</a> that lets people see the biweekly rate-of-change. It’s not very useful for understanding the magnitude like these <em>Worldometer</em> charts, but when you are trying to figure out if a particular wave is getting close to the top or not, that rate-of-change analysis is useful. Here are the results for the US and Malaysia. When the lines come back down to zero, it means the daily case count is declining over a two-week period:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-covid-biweekly-change.png" alt="COVID-19 Biweekly Change" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-covid-biweekly-change.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-covid-biweekly-change-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="413"></p>
<p>Some countries continue to have a zero-COVID policy. Australia for example remains in deep lockdown, with military and police enforcing it strictly. They have publicly stated that they will end lockdowns once Australia has a 70% vaccination rate for adults, while it’s currently under 30%. There are curfews, restrictions on movement, new police powers, etc. In the Greater Sydney area, there are limits on how long you can exercise outside for.</p>
<p>Their virus numbers continue to grow despite their lockdowns, although their number of daily cases and deaths is very low in per-capita terms.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-australia-covid.png" alt="Australia COVID-19" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-australia-covid.png 636w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-australia-covid-232x300.png 232w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" width="636" height="823"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Worldometer</em></p>
<p>Those sorts of policies make economic analysis more difficult, since it’s not just about the virus but also about politics, which is harder to quantify.</p>
<p>The initial policy back in early 2020 for most countries was to do lockdowns for a few weeks, to avoid acute hospital overcrowding and flatten the curve. Now, a number of countries have indefinite lockdown plans based around vaccination requirements with attempts to stamp out the virus entirely, along with significant restrictions on personal movement and the introduction of vaccine requirements to do many types of things. Some people are in favor of these types of programs, while some others are against them and have protested them.</p>
<p>Once populations have higher rates of vaccination, will regular booster shots become pseudo-mandatory in a number of countries as well, since being vaccinated is an impermanent status?</p>
<p><strong>Retail Sales Turbulence</strong></p>
<p>As I covered in prior reports that focused on the US business cycle, Q2 2021 was probably the top in year-over-year percent change growth for most indicators. As we head into the rest of this year, GDP growth will be positive but with a declining rate of change, meaning the economy is growing but at a decelerating rate.</p>
<p>Some areas of particular excess, however, are vulnerable to outright contraction, rather than just positive deceleration. Retail sales, for example, continue their downward trend:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-retail-sales.png" alt="Retail Sales" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-retail-sales.png 748w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-retail-sales-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" width="748" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>This most recent downtick data point confirmed the trend I described in the July 25th report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Retail sales remain well above trend, fueled by the extra personal income and a reduction in spending in certain other areas like travel. However, retail sales are showing signs of topping too, with a lag after personal income topped. My base case is that retail sales will cool off for a while but remain somewhat above its prior trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have concerns about consumer-facing companies, such as Nike (NKE) and Apple (AAPL) at current valuations. Stimulus checks and other fiscal injections from the past 16 months are wearing off, and rents are going up, which can squeeze consumers’ ability to spend on discretionary goods and services. They still on average have pent-up savings but the money isn’t flowing as much as it used to.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-personal-income.png" alt="Personal Income" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-personal-income.png 748w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-personal-income-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" width="748" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>Amazon falls into this camp too which is part of why they have run into some stock price turbulence lately, but given that they a) have a large cloud computing business and b) are trading at historically normal valuations for Amazon’s 20-year history, I’m less concerned with that company than with some others in the retail space, at least in terms of a 3-year forward performance viewpoint.</p>
<p>Plus, e-commerce sales have a more persistent growth trend (quarterly numbers):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-ecommerce.png" alt="E-Commerce Sales" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-ecommerce.png 652w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-ecommerce-300x207.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" width="652" height="450"></p>

<p><strong>China and Supply Chains Update</strong></p>
<p>China has had a perfect storm of bad news for investors in recent months.</p>
<p>Since they were first into the pandemic lockdown and first out of it, their credit cycle was ahead of the rest of the world. Early this year, their credit cycle began contracting, as it typically does every three years or so. Unlike the United States, China didn’t do large fiscal bailouts, so there are more winners and losers among companies based on their various exposures.</p>
<p>Next, President Xi has been performing a wide crackdown on ecommerce, private education, and IPOs broadly. Unlike the credit cycle, the severity of this was historically atypical, and has rightly spooked foreign investors, as they grow concerned about China’s shift towards more state control.</p>
<p>Third, China is in a month-long surge in COVID-19 cases and associated lockdowns, much like Southeast Asia. This problem extends beyond China, as some of the world’s largest shipping ports are closed with long lines of cargo ships floating outside those ports, disrupting global trade and creating yet more supply shortages.</p>
<p>China continues to be a risk, but with Chinese equities already beaten down so hard, and with the credit cycle already in negative territory, my base case is that the worst of the pain is behind for them. However, the effects from this are starting to ripple to the rest of the world, where in my view it is closer to the beginning than the end of the pain. This chart by Callum Thomas of Topdown Charts shows the Chinese credit cycle vs global PMI:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-china-credit-impulse.png" alt="China Credit Impulse" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-china-credit-impulse.png 728w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-china-credit-impulse-300x183.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" width="728" height="443"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/topdowncharts/status/1426079919075778561" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Topdown Charts</a></em></p>
<p>In other words to put it simply, I’m more concerned about the black line (global manufacturing) falling down a lot, than the blue line (Chinese credit cycle) going much lower. The blue line already had the pain, probably has a bit more pain ahead, and then can start finding a floor. The black line is just now rolling over from a very high level.</p>
<p>Indeed, Toyota <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-succumbs-to-chip-shortage-and-shuts-factories-11629372702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced last week</a> that they will cut vehicle production by a massive 40% in September due to acute semiconductor shortages. And this isn’t just a Chinese issue- Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand are big hubs for electronic assembly and that whole area has been hit hard by the delta variant over the past month or more.</p>
<p>As for Chinese equities themselves, my view at this time is that I’m neither divesting from them, nor am I increasing my allocations. The political tail risk is significant, which is why I limit position sizes, but the valuations are attractive and sentiment could barely be any worse at this point, which is why I maintain my positions. The harshness of the CCP crackdown against them and the degree to which they’ve corrected this year was certainly not within my base case. It has been the weakest part of my set of portfolios this year.</p>
<p>Alibaba and Tencent are the most oversold they have ever been in terms of the relative strength index, and also the cheapest they have ever been in terms of price/sales and most other metrics. JD is the second most oversold and second cheapest it has ever been. The question is to what extent will they be structurally affected vs cyclically affected by government policies. Here are some updated F.A.S.T. Graphs.</p>
<p>Alibaba:</p>

<p>Tencent:</p>

<p>JD (for which I tend to use operational cash flow as my main metric):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-jd-fastgraph.png" alt="JD FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-jd-fastgraph.png 968w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-jd-fastgraph-300x179.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-jd-fastgraph-768x459.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px" width="968" height="578"></p>
<p>In my view, the single biggest tail risk for Chinese equities would be a war for Taiwan. American investors could face a total loss in that scenario.</p>
<p>Considering how many US assets are owned by Chinese entities, and how many American companies have deep supply chain operations in China, such a scenario would have massive repercussions for the entire world, and acts as a large deterrent from kinetic war or abrupt bilateral divestment.</p>
<p>However, Chinese state media has ramped up their anti-Taiwan rhetoric over the past couple weeks in response to the United States’ problems in Afghanistan, although at this point it seems to be nationalistic posturing which they tend to do from time to time. This one was particularly blunt:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-global-times-tweet.png" alt="Global Times" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-global-times-tweet.png 609w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-global-times-tweet-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px" width="609" height="793"></p>
<p>Given how intertwined China and the US are, a war for Taiwan within the next couple years is unlikely. However, the deeper we head into the decade, the more unclear that situation becomes.</p>
<p>A long-term trend towards partial de-globalization is one of my structural inflationary themes.</p>
<p><strong>Dollar Update</strong></p>
<p>The dollar has been pretty strong lately. It resisted the various moments where it could have rolled over and instead touched higher highs:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-dollar-index.png" alt="Dollar Index" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-dollar-index.png 746w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-dollar-index-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" width="746" height="468"></p>
<p>And as is often the case, the strengthening dollar has been inversely correlated with equity performance, especially for more economically vulnerable stocks. The S&amp;P 500 has held up reasonably well mainly due to the top 5 or 10 mega-cap stocks, but 59% of US stocks are trading below their 50-day moving average. Market breadth is poor, in other words.</p>
<p>After the delta variant is finished, all else being equal we should see a pullback in the dollar and a rebound of global economic activity. However, if the Fed tries to taper their rate of asset purchases, it could delay that dollar-weakening outcome. This is an area I’ll be watching to see how it develops.</p>
<p>As macro analyst Luke Gromen has bluntly described a number of times, the Fed is “trying to ride two horses with one ass”, and those horses are increasingly going in opposite directions. The Fed wants to boost the economy and keep asset prices up (one horse), while also wanting to avoid a major drop in the dollar and a perception of runaway inflation (the second horse), and it’s really hard to succeed at both of those things at this phase of the <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/may-2021-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term debt cycle</a>. Rent and shelter inflation are just heating up in CPI, even as other areas cool off.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Update</strong></p>
<p>If there is an environment for gold to catch a bid, this period into the end of the year would be it. Economic growth is slowing down while inflation and supply chain issues remain elevated, and Treasuries offer yields that are well below the current inflation rate and below the expected forward inflation rate as measured by the TIPS market.</p>
<p>Gold has followed real rates inversely as it normally does, but with surprisingly weak magnitude. In the past few weeks, even the correlation itself broke down a bit:</p>

<p>The weakness in gold from August 2020 through February 2021 was expected and I wrote about that back in August, but the continued weakness from March 2021 to the present has been pretty surprising.</p>
<p>The gold market seems to be factoring every negative thing for the metal (any evidence that the Fed might try to taper), while not being excited about the pro-gold conditions that are leading the Fed to consider tapering (inflation running hotter and more persistently than consensus expectations, with deeply negative real rates).</p>
<p>I think either the crypto market is big enough to be stealing gold’s thunder at this point (over $2 trillion in combined crypto market cap, with hundreds of billions of dollars of inflows in 2021, some of which would have otherwise gone to gold), or gold is ready for a significant contrarian move from a capitulation bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Update</strong></p>
<p>The Fed has set up the narrative from a number of Fed speakers, and the new standing repo facilities, as a foundation to begin tapering their rate of asset purchases, either in Q4 of this year or Q1 of next year.</p>
<p>In other words, instead of buying $120 billion per month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities combined as they are currently doing, they could gradually start reducing it to $100 billion, and then to $80 billion, and then to $60 billion, and so on until they manage to get that down to zero monthly purchases.</p>
<p>The question is whether the US economy will slow down enough to make them delay that tapering plan, as it increasingly looks like it might.</p>
<p>One of the Fed’s more hawkish members that was quick to call for a taper, Robert Kaplan, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-kaplan/feds-kaplan-says-watching-delta-may-need-to-adjust-views-idUSS0N2LF02H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walked that back</a> this past Friday, saying that the delta variant might affect the timing. The Fed’s Jackson Hole Economic Symposium (a big annual event for global central bankers) on from August 26-28 has been changed to a virtual event due to the delta variant. So if they wanted cover not to taper, they’ve got it now.</p>
<p>Basically, they are behind the curve. They purposely let inflation run hot (which I expected and wrote about ahead of time, given where we are in the long-term debt cycle), but when it ran hotter than they thought, they seemingly got spooked into considering some tightening action ahead of their initial schedule. The problem is, the economic growth rate already peaked for the moment, so if they do tighten, they will be tightening into a slowing economy.</p>
<p>If they do that, it increases the odds that the market throws a fit like in Q4 of 2018, when the Fed was also tightening into a slowing economy. In addition to the S&amp;P 500 falling 20% in that quarter, there was a six-week period where no high-yield bonds were issued. Credit markets froze, which was the bigger problem underneath the surface that led the Fed to back off its tightening narrative.</p>
<p>Overall, I don’t expect the Fed to be able to raise interest rates by a meaningful amount or reduce their balance sheet in absolute terms any time soon. They might, however, be able to slow their rate of balance sheet expansion and then put in a couple 25 basis point rate hikes at some point.</p>
<p>Back in May 2021, I described the Fed’s way of thinking (using their preferred metric of core PCE):</p>
<blockquote><p>Since 2012, the Fed has used 2% annual price inflation as their definition of stable prices. They used to treat it as an approximate ceiling, but since the Fed’s policy shift in 2020, they changed to “average inflation targeting” where they plan to start using 2% as an average. If they undershoot that average for a while, they then want to deliberately overshoot it for a period of time to balance that out.</p>
<p>In other words, they want to look back several years from now and see about the same amount of red and green on this chart:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-30-core-pce.png" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-30-core-pce.png 681w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-5-30-core-pce-300x198.png 300w" alt="Core PCE Inflation" width="681" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>So, after this decade of red, they want to paint the next few years green. Given that they also want the unemployment rate to go down and are favoring that over stable prices, their current approach is pretty clear: keep the pedal pressed down for now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three months later, here’s an updated version of that chart:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-core-pce.png" alt="Core PCE" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-core-pce.png 652w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-core-pce-300x207.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" width="652" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>This will likely remain green for a while, especially as rent increases kick in, but the Fed seems concerned about speed and magnitude of its rise and wishes to prevent it from going too high.</p>
<p>Further complicating the Fed’s tapering decision is the US Treasury General Account. This is the US federal government’s cash balance at the Fed. Due to the debt ceiling preventing the Treasury from issuing new net debt (while they still need to meet all of their monthly spending requirements), the Treasury has instead spent down their cash balance to $338 billion, whereas their target for the quarter is $750 billion.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-tga.png" alt="Treasury General Account" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-tga.png 672w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-tga-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" width="672" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>Basically, whenever Congress settles the debt ceiling issue and the Treasury is allowed to issue more federal debt, probably in Q4, the Treasury will need to issue a lot of debt securities in order to get their cash balance back towards its target level. They want it to be $800 billion in Q4, as per their early-August statement.</p>
<p>As of this writing, the Fed is still buying $80 billion per month in Treasuries, at a time when the Treasury can’t perform net Treasury issuance.</p>
<p>I ran a poll on Twitter about Fed tapering and the results were that one third of the sample thinks tapering will happen by Q1 2022 and two thirds do not:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-poll.png" alt="Fed Taper Poll" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-poll.png 608w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-poll-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" width="608" height="413"></p>
<p>I’ll be looking for comments from Fed Chairman Powell at the Jackson Hole event on August 27, since that has been the consensus day on when he might announce an asset purchase tapering plan. Recent comments by Kaplan and others have made that a bit less likely. All else being equal, a delay in tapering, if it were to occur, should be somewhat dollar bearish and gold bullish.</p>
<p>My base case, loosely held, is that the Fed will discuss conditions for tapering at the Jackson Hole event, rather than announce a specific tapering date. In other words, they might define more specifically what triggers in terms of unemployment and/or inflation would lead them to taper. If it works out that way, this would in some sense be a tapering delay, citing the delta variant.</p>
<p>When it comes to the US economy itself, however, the Fed has only modest impact at this point. Economic performance will partly come down to whether there is another round of fiscal spending prior to the 2022 election or not, and whether the pent-up savings and easier lending conditions are enough to give the economy some rebound after the delta variant passes.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Note</h2>
<p>Bitcoin consolidated a couple times during this rally but so far has held its gains. It has a positive MACD crossover on the weekly chart as well:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-btcusd.png" alt="BTCUSD" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-btcusd.png 622w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-btcusd-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" width="622" height="480"></p>
<p>A backtest to as low as $40-$42k wouldn’t be too surprising, and would be bullish if it held that level as a higher-low and moved back up to new local highs. I have no clue if we’ll get that kind of pullback or not.</p>
<p>What we wouldn’t want to see is a pullback to below $40k, back into the prior consolidation channel. That would make this whole recent move look more like a bull trap rally.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m structurally bullish with a multi-year view, as part of a portfolio.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s open-source Lightning Network continues its phase of rapid adoption from a small base. Unlike a DeFi trading platform, this is a payments and data-sharing network with no separate token attached to it, and so it is much less inclined towards speculation, and that’s one of the reasons why it’s impressive that it’s rising so quickly now:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-lightning-capacity.png" alt="Lightning Capacity" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-lightning-capacity.png 608w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-lightning-capacity-300x298.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-lightning-capacity-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" width="608" height="604"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/lightning-network-capacity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Look Into Bitcoin</a></em></p>
<p>Bitnob, a leading Nigerian bitcoin app company, recently integrated the Lightning Network into its app. Nigeria has one of the highest per-capita adoption rates of bitcoin globally, and the country has tens of billions of dollars of incoming remittance payments per year. Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, publicly tested sending a payment to Bitnob’s CEO over the Lightning network. Basically, it’s becoming easier for Nigeria and other countries to receive remittance payments with the Lightning network, and skip Western Union (WU) and the associated fees.</p>
<p>IBEX Mercado, a Guatamalan bitcoin app company, also integrated Lightning with a feature called IBEX Pay. It allows merchants to accept bitcoin payments over Lightning, and they can choose to instantly convert some or all of it into USD or leave it as bitcoin, which is similar to the El Salvador legal tender model that they are experimenting with. Guatemala is physically close to El Salvador, and is similar in the sense that they have relatively high levels of bitcoin adoption. This approach can separate bitcoin the asset from Bitcoin/Lightning the payment network, which is a theme that Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs (one of the open source implementation companies of the Lightning Network) has forecasted for years.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter (TWTR), keeps publicly talking about eventually incorporating Lightning into Twitter. Dorsey has indicated a number of times that he doesn’t particularly like Ethereum, that he likes Bitcoin a lot, and plans to incorporate Bitcoin more into his business lines. Bitcoin is already a big component of Cash App at Square (SQ), his other company.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Note</h2>
<p>Ethereum has been riding high on the NFT art boom. The protocol continues to benefit in terms of price action from the perfect storm of one-way Eth 2.0 staking and the new EIP 1559, which was initiated with a hard fork and changed Ethereum’s monetary policy to be more deflationary.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-ethusd.png" alt="ETHUSD" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-ethusd.png 621w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-ethusd-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" width="621" height="480"></p>
<p>I treat Ethereum like an equity rather than money, since it had an initial coin offering, and has long-term roadmaps and marketing budgets, as well as two key organizations involved with its development. In that sense, the introduction of EIP 1559 is as though the Ethereum network is doing a significant share buyback program now, which should boost the per-token price.</p>
<p>However, EIP 1559’s more deflationary monetary policy has come at a cost; higher fees. Average fees are up since EIP 1559 went into effect, specifically because it effectively eliminated low-fee transactions:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22.jpg" alt="Ethereum Fees" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22.jpg 680w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" width="680" height="446"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/zndtoshi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retrieved at @zndtoshi</a></em></p>
<p>Basically, this should be good for intermediate-term Ethereum token price, but not necessarily good for Ethereum network usability, since Ethereum is mainly about frequent usage with higher velocity than Bitcoin. In the long run, that could negatively affect Ethereum’s scaling efforts and allow competitors like Solana to make headway in catching up to Ethereum’s dominant network effect in the smart contract market.</p>
<p>I continue to be tactically bullish on Ethereum as a speculation with a 6+ month view due to the Ethereum 2.0 one-way staking supply squeeze as my base case, but I still have concerns about its probability of maintaining long-term success against other smart contract competitors. Solana and Cardano have outperformed Ethereum since EIP 1559 was launched, and have reached new all-time highs.</p>

<p>CVS Health (CVS) is a large diversified retail pharmacy chain, pharmacy benefits manager, and health insurer.</p>
<p>In Q2 2021, the company brought in $72 billion in revenue. Among US companies, only Walmart, Amazon, and Apple have higher revenue than CVS, and United Healthcare (UNH) is roughly tied with it. Not many people would guess that CVS is a top-5 company by revenue, although its margins aren’t too high and its market capitalization is nowhere near the top of the list.</p>
<p>Its share count basically tells the company’s history:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-shares.png" alt="CVS Shares" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-shares.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-shares-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="414"></p>
<p>Those steep moves up in shares represent major acquisitions.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, CVS greatly expanded its number of locations with a large acquisition, which effectively turned them into a national chain.</p>
<p>In 2007, CVS acquired/merged with Caremark, creating a combined pharmacy chain and pharmacy benefits manager. They then began a long stretch of buybacks to reduce their share count.</p>
<p>In 2018, CVS acquired Aetna, one of the largest healthcare insurance providers.</p>
<p>The company also made many other acquisitions along the way, including important ones like MinuteClinic in 2006 and Target’s pharmacy business in 2015, but these types of acquisitions have not required issuing equity like their three biggest acquisitions did.</p>
<p>The 2018 Aetna acquisition is still relatively recent. The company greatly increased its cash flow production with that purchase, but had to take on a lot of debt to do it. Their #1 priority since that acquisition has been reducing their net debt, and they have already reduced it by $17 billion:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-net-debt.png" alt="CVS Net Debt" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-net-debt.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-net-debt-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="414"></p>
<p>By 2023, the company should comfortably meet its leverage target. At that point, they can start increasing the dividend and buying back shares.</p>
<p>Basically, the underlying combined business is a slow-growth mature company, and most of the cash can be returned to shareholders. At the moment, that is taking the form of debt reduction, but starting in a year or two, it should start to move towards dividend increases and share buybacks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company is close to the low end of its historical valuation range:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-valuation.png" alt="CVS Valuation" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-valuation.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-valuation-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="444"></p>
<p>Here’s the F.A.S.T. Graph:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-fastgraph.png" alt="CVS FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-fastgraph.png 968w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-fastgraph-300x180.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cvs-fastgraph-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px" width="968" height="581"></p>
<p>You can see that the dividend (white line) has been flat since 2018 when CVS acquired Aetna, although in about two years this should start to increase again.</p>
<p>Overall, the stock is cheap, but not a falling knife. It bottomed in 2019 and has been in a decent uptrend since then, as they continue with their strategy that has a lot of clarity to it at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Greater than the Sum of Parts</strong></p>
<p>CVS’s combination of a pharmacy, pharmacy benefits manager, in-store clinics, and health insurer gives it an interesting combination and set of incentives.&nbsp;Specifically, the company has two main levers to pull.</p>
<p>One lever is that with weak retail foot traffic, they want to reduce the number of square feet in each store devoted to general retail, and increase the allocation to clinical services. Basically, they want their floor space to be an asset, not a liability, as they compete against online competition.</p>
<p>The second lever is that they want to keep medical costs down for their Aetna health insurer as much as possible. One way to do that is to provide low-cost clinic visits in their stores, for simple medical issues that do not require a physician. They’ve done this to some extent with MinuteClinic, but are aggressively expanding this with HealthHub to include ongoing maintenance care of conditions such as diabetes.</p>
<p>If CVS pulls this off well, their stores will be an Amazon-resistant asset, rather than decaying with the rest of the brick-and-mortar retail industry. A CVS location functions as a convenience store, a pharmacy, and a clinic, while the company has pharmacy benefit management and health insurance operations offsite.</p>
<p>Overall, I like CVS as a cash-cow business. The combination of a cheap valuation, clear strategic plan, and most of the cash being used for debt reduction followed by likely going towards shareholder returns, makes a compelling value/dividend play for the long run.</p>
<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>
<p>While CVS operates in a mature industry and is not economically sensitive/cyclical, it does face some key structural risks.</p>
<p><em>Amazon Threat</em></p>
<p>Amazon has entered the prescription business, and the market has been spooked about that for a while. However, Amazon doesn’t have a lot of the advantages that CVS has with its in-house pharmacy benefit manager, and isn’t necessarily cheaper than CVS.</p>
<p>CVS has the #1 pharmacy market share in the US, and has been holding steady. I expect that there is plenty of room for CVS, Amazon, Walgreens, Walmart, and various grocers in this large industry. CVS acquired the pharmacies inside of Target locations several years ago and continues to operate them, and Target has been doing very well as one of the top-performing US retailers, which benefits CVS’s partnership with them.</p>
<p>Still, the potential of losing market share to mega-conglomerates like Amazon is indeed a key risk to be aware of, and helps keep CVS’s valuation lower than it might otherwise be.</p>
<p><em>Inflation</em></p>
<p>Like many other employers, CVS is likely facing rising wage pressures for its workers, and may struggle to pass along the full cost of those increases onto consumers via higher product prices. Additionally, Cigna was hit with higher-than-expected medical costs last quarter, which could happen to CVS as well. I’d be a buyer of that correction if it were to occur.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time, I expect CVS to get through this inflationary period pretty well, in part because its valuation is so low anyway. However, this does remain a threat to margins and could lead to underperforming quarters, and surprise stock price drops in response.</p>
<p><em>Regulation</em></p>
<p>Health insurers face the long-term possibility of single payer healthcare being enacted in the United States. However, this politically seems off the table until at least 2024, and probably much later. While I’m not a political expert, it would seem that either a removal of the filibuster, or a filibuster-proof 60 Democrat senators would be required to get such a bill past Republicans.</p>
<p>During President Obama’s first term, he had 60 Democrat senators and yet still had to drop the public option from the Affordable Care Act, because even among Democrats these types of policies are not fully accepted, and there are considerable lobbying efforts against such changes across party lines.</p>
<p>So, this remains a long-term possibility but not a significant risk for several years.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>There is a lot of fear in markets. Although the S&amp;P 500 is still near all-time highs (held up by mega-caps such as Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Alphabet), small caps, value stocks, cyclical stocks, foreign developed stocks, and foreign emerging stocks, are significantly off their highs. Market breadth is low, domestically and globally.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cnn-fear-greed.png" alt="CNN Fear Greed" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cnn-fear-greed.png 656w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-8-22-cnn-fear-greed-295x300.png 295w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" width="656" height="667"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a></em></p>
<p>A lot of people put cyclical stocks into one conceptual bucket but I’m mentally separating energy and consumer-facing companies at the moment, when making 3-5 year allocation decisions.</p>
<p>For the energy sector, I suspect that the worst is already behind it, as the world is closer to the end of the delta wave than the beginning of it. The lockdowns throughout Asia Pacific have been a big weight for the sector for the past couple months. So, I don’t mind owning high-quality energy producers and transporters with a long-term view. I’m avoiding the speculative and leveraged ones, with high costs of production and lots of debt. When the world moves past the delta variant, demand for energy should resume, especially from the developing world.</p>
<p>For the consumer discretionary sector, especially for the US, I think that we are closer to the beginning of the pain than the end of the pain. This sector has been riding high on stimulus checks and extra unemployment support, but those programs are wearing off. Consumer-facing stocks are also facing supply chain issues and rising wage pressures for their workers.</p>
<p>So, between the two, I prefer high-quality energy stocks as my cyclical area of choice with a long-term outlook, along with some structural growth stocks like Roku, and some relatively non-cyclical value/dividend stocks like CVS that have risks and opportunities that are somewhat detached from the economic cycle.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/Lyn-Alden-Signature.png" alt="Lyn Alden Signature" width="204" height="126"></p>
