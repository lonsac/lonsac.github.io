<p>The macro portion of this report focuses on economic US cycle indicators, interest rates, the dollar, gold, and copper. Then there’s a BTC/ETH section to update some of the action in the digital asset ecosystem.&nbsp;The stock section takes a look at the low breadth in the markets (basically anything outside of US tech has been underperforming lately), and provides an update on Chinese stocks.</p>
<p>As a housekeeping note, I published a public article on <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/compass-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compass Mining</a>, which is a fast-growing company that lets people buy their own bitcoin miner at book value and mine bitcoin with it in one of their partner facilities.</p>
<p>Also, I published the <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/july-2021-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public newsletter issue for July</a>. I sent out an extra email for premium subscribers last week to make sure they saw it. For those who haven’t read it yet, it would be good to do so prior to reading the macro section of this premium report.</p>
<h2>Macro View</h2>
<p>Global virus cases are showing initial signs of forming another rounded top to roll over. Deaths attributed to the virus come with a lag but in this cycle haven’t risen much, which is a great sign.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-global-covid.png" alt="Global COVID-19" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-global-covid.png 617w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-global-covid-204x300.png 204w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px" width="617" height="909"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldometer</a></em></p>
<p>One of the clearest cases of that was in the UK where they had a pretty sizable spike in cases but a very small number of deaths this time, unlike prior spikes.</p>
<p>However, as I’ve reported for a little while now, southeast Asia is being hit the hardest at the moment, going through what India went through a couple months ago. The good news is that Indonesia seems to be over the worst of it in terms of cases, and deaths should roll over with a bit of a lag.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-indonesia-covid.png" alt="Indonesia COVID-19" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-indonesia-covid.png 645w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-indonesia-covid-233x300.png 233w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" width="645" height="830"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Worldometer</em></p>
<p>So far since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, Indonesia reported 82,000 deaths from the virus, which amounts to 0.03% of their population. Most of those occurred over the past year, since they were not one of the early-hit regions. In a normal year, they have about 1.8 million deaths, so if the reported death count is accurate, it increased the average fatality rate by about 5% over the past year.</p>
<p>The rest of southeast Asia seems to be a bit behind Indonesia’s pattern, in the sense that they aren’t quite showing a top in daily new case counts.</p>
<p><strong>The US Business Cycle</strong></p>
<p>Here is my updated heatmap of various economic indicators for the U.S. economy over the past five years, measured in year-over-year percent change terms. This lets us see a broad spectrum of the economy rather than cherry pick good or bad data points to fit a narrative.</p>
<p>The economy is at a high peak but showing initial signs of entering a soft patch in rate-of-change terms, largely due to harder base effects along with fiscal stimulus wearing off.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-heatmap.png" alt="Economic Heatmap" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-heatmap.png 687w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-heatmap-300x250.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" width="687" height="572"></p>
<p>The chart starts from the bottom and goes up over five years, and each column represents one of the economic indicators.</p>
<p>For most of the chart, I use a green/yellow/red color spectrum. Green indicates solid growth, yellow indicates medium, and orange/red indicate slow growth or contraction, relative to the rest of the 5-year period for that indicator. In other words, green is good and red is bad.</p>
<p>For inflation CPI, there is a separate blue/white/red color scale, because high or low inflation in a vacuum is not necessarily “good” or “bad” in the same way as the rest of the heat map. Red indicates higher price inflation, white indicates medium, and blue is lower price inflation, relative to the 5-year period. Economic slowdowns tend to be dis-inflationary while economic booms tend to be pro-inflationary, but there are also some business cycles that slow down with high inflation, and thus become “stagflationary”. So, inflation gets its own color scheme.</p>

<p>Personal income is returning to trend, because stimulus checks and other government transfer payments are running out. Child tax credits and sizable unemployment benefits are still keeping it mildly elevated for the remainder of this year but absent further stimulus, it should return somewhat closer to trend, albeit maybe slightly elevated due to a structural bump in wages. That last part remains to be confirmed at this early stage.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-personal-income.png" alt="Personal Income" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-personal-income.png 669w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-personal-income-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" width="669" height="450"></p>

<p>Retail sales remain well above trend, fueled by the extra personal income and a reduction in spending in certain other areas like travel. However, retail sales are showing signs of topping too, with a lag after personal income topped. My base case is that retail sales will cool off for a while but remain somewhat above its prior trend, because this is a nominal chart and higher prices will mean higher total sales numbers:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-retail-sales.png" alt="Retail Sales" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-retail-sales.png 669w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-retail-sales-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" width="669" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>And as would make sense with such a high spike, the purchasing managers index appears to be topping as well:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-pmi.png" alt="PMI" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-pmi.png 684w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-pmi-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" width="684" height="364"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Trading Economics</em></p>
<p>Overall, the US economy appears to be in decent shape, but coming down from its sugar high. There continue to be a lot of structural issues under the surface as well, such as the long-term trade deficit, heavy reliance on fiscal deficits, and high levels of wealth concentration compared to most developed country peers. So, the median person has more financial stress than the aggregate statistics would imply.</p>
<p><strong>Dollar Update</strong></p>
<p>The dollar index continues to grind upward. It still hasn’t hit higher highs yet but the trend has been strong lately:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-dollar-index.png" alt="Dollar Index" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-dollar-index.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-dollar-index-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="439"></p>
<p>With the delta variant of the virus impacting southeast Asia, with Australia locking itself down again over a rise in cases (despite only 4 reported deaths from the virus in the month of July), with China cracking down on industry after industry within its borders, and with US fiscal stimulus wearing off, the dollar has been gaining strength as a risk-off trade.</p>
<p>However, most of that strength is coming from the USDEUR portion, since the euro is the largest weight in the dollar index, and the euro has been weak lately as the ECB doubles down on dovish monetary policy. The USDJPY, USDCHF, and USDCNY charts aren’t quite as bullish for the dollar within the past month (more of a sideways chop).</p>
<p>My base case is to see the dollar index roll over in the next several months as the world moves past this delta variant, however that outlook is not a particularly high-conviction one at the moment. There are a lot of variables to contend with including the questions of US infrastructure stimulus and the US debt ceiling debate, so for now I’m watching for higher highs in the dollar index or not.</p>
<p>A risk for the dollar and S&amp;P 500 here is that with the rest of the world being so messy at the moment and everyone piling into US equities and pushing up the dollar, it’s creating a coiled spring to potentially reverse in the months ahead after this rough patch.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Update</strong></p>
<p>In terms of direction, gold continues to follow real rates (the 10-year Treasury yield minus the TIPS inflation breakeven rate) inversely:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-gold-vs-real-rates.png" alt="Gold vs Real Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-gold-vs-real-rates.png 669w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-gold-vs-real-rates-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" width="669" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>In terms of magnitude, gold has kept up with broad money supply growth per capita. This chart shows both indexed to 100 in 1995:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-gold-vs-m2.png" alt="Gold vs M2" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-gold-vs-m2.png 669w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-gold-vs-m2-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" width="669" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>I consider gold to be fairly-valued at this time by most metrics that I track. I kind of expected it to overshoot its fair value in this type of environment by now, but so far that only happened briefly in summer 2020. Young investors and tech-savvy investors that may have otherwise flocked into gold as a fiat currency debasement hedge tended to flock into bitcoin and various cryptos instead, so that likely took a bit of the edge off of what gold might have otherwise done.</p>
<p>Basically, gold has consistently made sense directionally with the variables it correlates with (real yields), but has been somewhat underwhelming in terms of magnitude, although not really undershooting its magnitude trend line either. It just hasn’t substantially overshot as one may have reasonably expected it to.</p>
<p>The broad money supply growth rate per capita remains at about a 12% annualized rate at the current time, so with a multi-year view, that should be pretty bullish for gold. Gold can do well in either an inflationary or disinflationary environment, as long as real yields are low while broad money supply keeps trending up.</p>
<p>Scenarios that would be good for gold are a) inflation expectations heating up along with nominal Treasury yields, but with inflation expectations rising faster or b) if we enter another disinflationary period and both inflation expectations and nominal Treasury yields go down, but Treasury yields go down faster. Both of those would result in lower real yields, likely supporting gold. That second case (disinflation) is what happened from mid-2018 to mid-2020 during gold’s big bull run.</p>
<p>Scenarios that would be bad for gold are a) inflation expectations heating up but with nominal Treasury yields rising faster than inflation expectations or b) disinflation but with inflation expectations falling faster than nominal Treasury yields. Both of those would result in higher real yields, likely putting pressure on gold.</p>
<p>Overall, I remain constructive on gold as part of a diversified portfolio. Compared to many US assets that are at expensive extremes, it is at roughly fair value and with very mixed sentiment, and so I like the overall risk/reward aspect of it here.</p>
<p><strong>Copper-to-Gold Ratio and Interest Rates</strong></p>
<p>The copper-to-gold ratio (how many ounces of gold it takes to buy a ton of copper) hit a peak in May, had a reduction in June, and was pretty flat so far in July. The copper-to-gold ratio has always been interesting, because it matches up with economic cycles rather cleanly. Roughly every three years, the ratio completes an up/down cycle.</p>
<p>This chart shows the copper-to-gold ratio in blue, along with the 10-year Treasury yield in red:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-copper-gold.png" alt="Copper To Gold" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-copper-gold.png 669w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-copper-gold-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" width="669" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>Basically, there are early signs of the copper/gold ratio starting to flatten out and later roll over, in gold’s favor. This isn’t a perfect metric, but something to keep an eye on. It’s confirming the decline in Treasury yields, and it makes sense in the context of many economic indicators hitting their peak levels in rate-of-change terms.</p>
<p>As for signals from the Treasury market itself, I consider those signals to be mostly irrelevant in terms of magnitude in the era of massive QE, but still relevant in terms of direction. In other words, it is in significant part due to Fed purchases of Treasuries that the 10-year Treasury rate is so low compared to both actual inflation and inflation expectations (the Fed has removed so much Treasury collateral from the system), but when Treasury yields shoot up or shoot down (while the Fed maintains a pretty consistent monthly purchase rate), that gives us some signal through the noise about what the bond market is thinking.</p>
<p>Lastly, the interest rate spread between junk bonds and nominally risk-free Treasuries may have bottomed, which means the market is pricing in a slight uptick in default risk. I don’t know if it will start rising, but after hitting a 10-year low, it doesn’t exactly have much room to go lower. If it starts chopping along sideways, that tends to result in a choppy equity market as well.</p>

<p><strong>Treasury Drama</strong></p>
<p>One of the most challenging parts of the market at the moment in my view is forecasting the likely direction of Treasury yields for the remainder of this year. So for the most part, I’m not betting heavily one way or another for what they will do.</p>
<p>If I were expecting higher yields, I’d add some bank stocks or other steepener trades, and prefer value over growth equities in general. If I were expecting lower yields, I’d prioritize gold and growth stocks. At the moment, I’m simply maintaining my existing balance of both.</p>
<p>Back on March 19th, 2021, the Fed announced that they would not extend the SLR exemption for banks. That happens to be the day that long-duration Treasuries hit their peak yield for this cycle so far:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-slr.png" alt="Treasury Yields and SLR" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-slr.png 669w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-slr-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" width="669" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>I was somewhat surprised that they did not extend SLR for another six months or so. What we’ve seen since then is a big rise in reverse repo activity with the Fed, and the Fed expanded access to that facility.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-reverse-repo.png" alt="Reverse Repo" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-reverse-repo.png 669w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-reverse-repo-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" width="669" height="450"></p>

<p>This occurred at a time when the Treasury was drawing down its account with the Fed. In other words, back in 2020 Secretary Mnuchin issued bonds at a faster rate than fiscal expenditures, which grew the Treasury’s cash balance. Then in 2021, Secretary Yellen reversed this back to more normal levels by issuing bonds at a slower rate than fiscal expenditures, which drew down the Treasury’s cash balance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-tga.png" alt="Treasury General Account" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-tga.png 669w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-tga-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" width="669" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>Yellen’s Treasury sharply revised down the forecast for how many bonds they would issue in the first half of 2021. So, with the Fed buying $80 billion in Treasuries per month and the Treasury sharply reducing its issuance rate of Treasuries for a period of time (while still spending reserves back into the banking system and consequently pushing things into money market funds), that altered the Treasury supply/demand landscape significantly.</p>
<p>Now, all else being equal, my base case would be that in the second half of this year, as rent inflation heats up, as the world moves past this delta variant lockdown cycle, and as the Treasury stops drawing down its TGA, we would see a moderate rise in Treasury yields. Collateral shortages would dissipate, and Treasury rates would move up.</p>
<p>Because, putting Federal Reserve purchases of Treasury securities aside for moment, one would assume that the private sector portion of the Treasury market would want positive real rates on the long end of the curve (meaning, that Treasury yields would be above the Treasury market’s own forward inflation expectations).</p>
<p>If we keep the Fed out of the equation for a moment and look at it in face value, the Treasury market is currently expressing, through the TIPS market, that it thinks forward 10-year average inflation will be 2.38% while the 10-year Treasury yield is only 1.30%. The only other time this happened since the introduction of the TIPS market was for about a year in 2012/2013, and the resolution there was that 10-year Treasury yields shot back up into positive real territory even though the inflation expectations of the Treasury market were declining. Basically, the Treasury market just wanted to get back to having yields higher than their expected forward inflation rate:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-treasuries-vs-breakevens.png" alt="Treasuries vs Breakevens" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-treasuries-vs-breakevens.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-treasuries-vs-breakevens-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="430"></p>
<p>So, in that environment, as Treasury collateral shortages from this TGA drawdown subside, I’d expect a similar outcome over the next year; for rates to shoot up to positive inflation-adjusted territory, at maybe 2.5% or so.</p>
<p>However, we have to bring realpolitik back into it. The Fed is still buying $80 billion in Treasuries per month, and Congress is fighting over the debt ceiling again. Until the debt ceiling impasse is resolved, the Treasury won’t be able to increase its amount of Treasury securities outstanding within a week from now. For several months, they will be able to juggle their books and draw down their TGA even further than they expected to (it’s already roughly where they want it). That would contribute to ongoing Treasury collateral shortages while it happens, thus potentially keeping Treasury yields suppressed.</p>
<p>So, I have a list of variables to monitor, mainly the debt ceiling. Since I don’t know how some of those variables will resolve in any given month, I don’t have conviction on the direction of Treasury yields, although I do think underlying inflation levels are likely to remain hot, even as the categories causing that inflation rotate to some extent.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Note</h2>
<p>Moving on from the broad macro section, bitcoin had quite weak price action for a while, and fell a few hundred dollars below $30k support for a day. Then it bounced sharply and is chopping around back in the low/mid $30ks. That $30k region remains important support due to a lot of volume and round number support there.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-btcusd.png" alt="BTCUSD Chart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-btcusd.png 652w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-btcusd-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" width="652" height="390"></p>
<p>I remain structurally bullish on BTC over the long run, but would need to see a firm breakout over $41,000 to consider the bull market back on in a more tactical sense.</p>
<p>The sharp bounce occurred shortly before the <a href="https://www.thebword.org/c/the-b-word" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BWord</a> event, and might or might not have been correlated to that as investors front-ran the event a bit. The BWord event was a collaboration between Jack Dorsey’s Square, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, and Paradigm, and the purpose was to educate institutional investors about bitcoin with a couple dozen presenters. One of Dorsey’s goals was to have a discussion with Elon Musk as well, since Musk’s view on the asset has flip-flopped in recent months.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-bword.png" alt="BWord Tweet" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-bword.png 609w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-bword-263x300.png 263w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px" width="609" height="694"></p>
<p>The discussion with Dorsey and Musk bounced around a bit. Musk revealed that SpaceX owns bitcoin, in addition to Tesla (TSLA). Since SpaceX is not publicly-traded, the fact that it owns bitcoin is new information. Besides that, the discussion was rather dispersed. Dorsey expressed strong bullish sentiment on it, and lately in a few venues he has discussed incorporating Bitcoin and Lightning more into Twitter. His other company Square is launching a crypto subsidiary to focus on Bitcoin-based hardware wallets and DeFi. Cathie Wood didn’t get a lot of words in; it was mostly the Musk show with a side order of Dorsey. Her firm has been buying the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Coinbase (COIN) in recent days though.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting sections in the event was the set of panels about regulation, since the SEC is currently receiving a flood of proposals for bitcoin ETFs. For the headline regulatory panel, they had one of the five current SEC commissioners, Hester Peirce, give an interview. She has a favorable outlook on allowing bitcoin-based products and pointed out that a number of other countries have launched bitcoin ETFs before the United States. However, her comments suggest that the overall opinion of the other SEC commissions is more mixed.</p>
<p>For another regulatory panel, they had the acting director of FinCEN (the US Treasury’s financial crimes bureau) as part of a panel and he was also constructive. Basically, this event sought to bring developers, analysts, regulators, and VCs together to clear up misconceptions about bitcoin and to provide updates on regulation, which remains an unclear situation.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning Capacity</strong></p>
<p>I was also invited this past week to give a talk along with Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, to about 40 institutional clients of an investment bank advisory firm. The focus was on some of the technical details of the Bitcoin network as well as Bitcoin’s second layer, Lightning.</p>
<p>Lightning is an open source framework that a few companies, including Lightning Labs, Blockstream, and ACINQ, build implementations for.</p>
<p>The main takeaway of that discussion was that although the Bitcoin network is over 12 years old now, the Lightning network is only about 3 years old and starting to reach critical mass ever since late 2020. Lightning currently looks similar to how Bitcoin looked in 2012. So it’s still kind of under the radar but is reaching the point where folks probably should pay attention to it in terms of how it affects bitcoin the asset, and how it brings a new technology stack to other industries.</p>
<p>Lightning itself doesn’t have a token, so it can’t be directly invested in, although there are various private startups that focus on Lightning that have raised some seed and venture rounds. Instead, monitoring Lightning is about monitoring the use-cases of bitcoin the asset, and how it can potentially disrupt existing industries. If Lightning were to fail or stagnate, it would be pretty bearish for bitcoin the asset, while a successful Lightning layer greatly improves Bitcoin’s network effect and set of use-cases.</p>
<p>This weekend, Lightning reached about 2k BTC capacity:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-lightning-capacity.png" alt="Lightning Capacity" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-lightning-capacity.png 654w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-lightning-capacity-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" width="654" height="371"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://defipulse.com/lightning-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi Pulse</a></em></p>
<p>Lightning Labs <a href="https://lightninglabs.substack.com/p/the-flywheel-is-starting-to-spin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considers four main reasons</a> for this recent breakout in the network’s capacity:</p>
<p>-Technical development has hit a point where it has abstracted enough technical details so that regular people can join and start using it as power-users that build channels and earn transaction fees. So, there is a sharp rise in grassroots peer communities like plebnet on Telegram that help each other do that.</p>
<p>-Exchanges and custodial lightning wallets have added a lot of capital onto the Lightning network in recent months to start using it more. They’ve done some record-sized payments via Lightning compared to the typical size of Lightning payments, as the network’s liquidity and capacity keep improving.</p>
<p>-El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender, and most of the activity there is via the Lightning network rather than the Bitcoin base layer. Other countries have expressed interest in using Lightning for remittances as well. A number of apps like Strike and Bottlepay have hit some degree of critical mass here for using the Lightning network to transmit small and medium-sized payments.</p>
<p>-There is a rise in third layer businesses, such as Sphinx Chat and Impervious Technologies, that use the Lightning network as a way to transmit data, in addition to just transmitting value. Sphinx chat is a peer-to-peer messaging platform that runs on Lightning and allows users to attach micropayments with their messages, while Impervious Technologies is releasing a VPN powered by Lightning.</p>
<blockquote><p>As an example of what can be developed utilizing the Impervious API, Impervious is releasing a dynamic VPN that leverages the Lightning Network to provide on-demand, high-bandwidth VPN services. The Impervious API can operate from behind hostile networks and denied access areas using the Lightning Network as a credential exchange and transport layer to establish peer-to-peer, secured channels for censorship resistant data transmissions.</p>
<p>Applications being built on the Impervious.ai API include peer-to-peer streaming video, podcasts, live events, news reporting, distributed storage, and VOIP-based communications.</p>
<p>–<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imperviousai-closes-venture-round-301301942.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2021 Impervious Technologies seed financing press release</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, BTC/LN is becoming a decentralized protocol for a host of other applications based on transmitting data, in addition to its core purpose of storing and transmitting value.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Note</h2>
<p>While I have ongoing long-term concerns about the technical integrity of Ethereum’s blockchain (mainly related to insufficient decentralization and a sizable number of attack surfaces), the price chart is looking okay here.</p>
<p>The ETH/BTC ratio is showing some strength with higher lows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-ethbtc.png" alt="ETHBTC Chart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-ethbtc.png 666w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-ethbtc-300x260.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" width="666" height="577"></p>
<p>Ethereum 2.0 staking (over 6.4 million ETH now) is soaking up a lot of liquid coins. The number of ETH on exchanges continues to drop, and is moving down faster than BTC at the moment:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-ethereum-exchanges.png" alt="Ethereum on Exchanges" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-ethereum-exchanges.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-ethereum-exchanges-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="393"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://glassnode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glassnode</a></em></p>
<p>Ethereum is about to launch EIP-1559 in August, which will change how transaction fees work and will add a deflationary component (burning part of the transaction fees) to offset some of the inflationary component (issuing new ETH with each block). This should further support a supply squeeze. In my <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">otherwise-critical public piece on Ethereum</a> from January of this year, EIP-1559 was my most bullish/favorable section, and that aspect is ready to launch.</p>
<p>I would need to see ETH break firmly over $2,400 to consider the bull market back on, and after that I’d be looking to see it clear $2,900 to further confirm it.</p>
<p>Depending on events and opportunities at the time, I would consider a 1-2% speculative allocation to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) in the No Limits portfolio, with maybe a 6-12 month timeframe, if I see more signs of a break-out (eg ETH over $2,400). The ETHE fund used to be terrible because it traded at a ridiculous premium to its net asset value, but now it trades at a 10% discount to net asset value.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-ethe-chart.png" alt="ETHE Chart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-ethe-chart.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-ethe-chart-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="430"></p>
<p>The No Limits portfolio already has a 5.6% position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is a position that we’ve already made a lot of money on and extracted more than our cost basis from, while letting the rest ride. I expect to hold the rest for a long time. For those who followed those pre-announced trades for GBTC in the No Limits portfolio, here was the history:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-gbtc-history.png" alt="GBTC Trade History" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-gbtc-history.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-gbtc-history-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="414"></p>
<h2>Portfolio Updates</h2>
<p>After reviewing them, I have no changes for the model portfolios at this time, and only a small change to the Other Holdings section.</p>
<p>We’re at a macro decision point, with a balanced portfolio. The emphasis is on a mix of high-quality companies, from both the value side and the growth side.</p>
<p><strong>Top 12 List</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletter Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>Fortress Income</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>ETF-Only Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>No Limits Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>Other Holdings</strong></p>
<p>-Buy another tranche of shares of Tencent (TCEHY). Not a ton, but topping off my position a bit on bearish market sentiment.</p>
<h2>Equity Breadth Analysis</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, I was planning on focusing the stock portion of this report on a bullish Facebook (FB) update, which is a stock I’ve been long for a while now in the newsletter portfolio. However, Facebook stock popped up 5% on Friday, and is up 10% in the past week alone, so it’s already rather hot at the moment. I remain quite bullish and long, but I think it may be best to save a Facebook update for another time.</p>
<p>Instead, I’d like to take a look at bad breadth (breadth, not breath!) in the global equity market, since it’s either a sign of a deep correction or an opportunity to buy some companies that have already sold off by quite a bit. In other words, instead of looking at something that just popped up, let’s look where things are doing poorly.</p>
<p>The CNN fear/greed index recently hit the lowest levels since the early-2020 phase of the pandemic, meaning fear is rather high.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-fear-greed.png" alt="CNN Fear and Greed Index" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-fear-greed.png 655w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-fear-greed-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" width="655" height="363"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN Fear and Greed Index</a></em></p>
<p>That’s pretty interesting, because the S&amp;P 500 was hovering around all-time highs consistently for the past couple months. Its deepest drawdown from all-time highs in the past couple months was less than 3%. The market spent a couple weeks correcting by 2-3% and everyone became afraid?</p>
<p>The answer is more clear under the surface of the index. The mega-cap tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN) have been holding the S&amp;P 500 up with new highs. The median stock within the S&amp;P 500, small cap US stocks, emerging markets stocks, commodity stocks, meme stocks, and most stocks in general have been experiencing a consolidation and/or drawdown.</p>
<p>More stocks are making 52-week lows than 52-week highs, despite the index as a whole making 52-week highs. And about 60% of US stocks are below their 50-day moving average:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-nyse50.png" alt="NYSE 50 Day" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-nyse50.png 623w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-nyse50-300x231.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" width="623" height="479"></p>
<p>This performance chart since mid-February breaks that down a bit further:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-equity-performance.png" alt="Equity Performance" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-equity-performance.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-7-25-equity-performance-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="481"></p>
<p>Since February, emerging markets logged a 21% underperformance gap vs the S&amp;P 500. US Small caps were next-worst, and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 16%. Developed ex-US markets have been in the middle, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 by about 7%.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Equities Update</strong></p>
<p>After a strong year in 2020, Chinese stocks have been among the worst-performers in 2021, and they constitute a sizable chunk of many emerging markets indices.</p>
<p>The country continues to go through a declining credit impulse (which is typical every three years or so), while regulators crack down on tech stocks and other industries (which is not typical; it’s been a harder crackdown than any of their prior ones).</p>
<p>It started in late 2020 when regulators went after Ant Financial and Jack Ma in particular. They then broadened that crackdown to the whole ecommerce space. Earlier this month, they forced ride-hailing app Didi (DIDI) to delist from app stores until they regulate user data differently. This week, they went hard after for-profit education companies, and made it so that companies wishing to IPO in a foreign market have to announce it to Chinese regulators ahead of time.</p>
<p>Valuations and investor sentiment on Chinese stocks is nearly rock-bottom at this point. Investors have to contend with the tail risk possibility of the United States forcing some Chinese companies to delist from US exchanges if relations between the countries weakens, and China itself cracking down on its own companies and taking steps to make it harder for them to list on US exchanges.</p>
<p>Media personality Jim Cramer said on Friday that “you can’t buy Chinese stocks”, referring to the rug pulls that the country’s authoritarian government can do, and has recently done, on investors.</p>
<p>This is in sharp contrast to a month ago when Cramer said, “I would try to get as many shares as you can” for the Didi IPO. The stock is down 40% from its early-July IPO.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to make fun of Jim Cramer here, but rather, using him as an example of shifting market sentiment on China. Investors have plenty of logical reasons not to want to invest in China. And Cramer was macro-aware when he recommended Didi; he referenced the common fraud and problems in China, but suggested that certain large caps are fine (which is a sentiment I generally share). Unluckily for Cramer, Chinese regulators made Didi de-list their app soon after IPO. It’ll be back in app stores at some point, since the concern is mainly around how the company uses its data, but it’s a major disruption and they could face significant fines and structural changes.</p>
<p>Back in September 2020, Cramer called oil a “perma short” and within months it rose over 75% in price from about $40 to more than $70. Basically, I like seeing areas where market sentiment is extremely negative. When things appear uninvestable, is often when they are ironically the most investable, or at least the most speculate-able with cautious position-sizing.</p>
<p>I personally avoid all small and mid-sized Chinese stocks, unless they are part of an ETF. I invest in a handful of large-cap Chinese stocks that I follow pretty closely, and only with moderate position sizes. Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY), JD (JD) and Baidu (BIDU) all look interesting at current levels, but only for contrarian investors.</p>
<p>This chart shows the percent of highs for these four stocks since they’ve been public. Currently, three of them are well over 30% down from their peak levels, while BIDU is down nearly 50%.</p>

<p>Tencent stock in particular looks a lot like it did three years ago, when Chinese regulators cracked down on it and temporarily stopped approving new video game releases until in the view of regulators, they made steps towards reducing youth video gaming addictions or overuse.</p>

<p>I originally recommend Tencent back in August 2020 when it was breaking out of that consolidation. For the first six months after that, it greatly outperformed, but once the full Chinese tech crackdown expanded in February 2021, the stock fell, and is now back down to the same level as in August 2020. However, the underlying company has grown 20-25% since that time.</p>
<p>So, the stock got hit with a tail risk against an otherwise sound thesis, so it’s time for an update.</p>
<p>Tencent operates two major social networks in China, one of the two largest payment systems in China, and has a global games business. They also have a set of investments in other companies, like JD (JD) and Sea Ltd (SE) and many smaller ones.</p>

<p><em>Chart Source: Tencent Q1 2021 Results</em></p>
<p>The company has been a good steward of capital, with smart investments and well-executed core operations. The stock is near the bottom end of its price/sales ratio history over the last decade, and sales have probably gone up slightly from their latest quarter (meaning the current ratio is probably a bit lower).</p>

<p>Back in 2018/2019, during a milder crackdown on tech companies, Tencent was near the heart of it with the long suspension of new video games being approved by regulators. Here in 2021, Tencent has been affected but hasn’t been at the heart of the storm. The heart of the storm so far has been on Alibaba, Didi, and education companies.</p>
<p>The one area where regulators are hitting Tencent this time is to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-24/china-orders-tencent-to-give-up-exclusive-music-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevent it from having exclusive streaming rights</a> to music, although that’s mainly about its publicly-traded music arm, Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME). Regulators reviewed some of Tencent’s past acquisitions and in simplified terms, found that they basically have too much of that market, and that they didn’t report acquisitions properly to get full approval to avoid anti-competitive practices. As part of this, they’re being slapped with a token fine equivalent to about $77,000 USD and more importantly, told to change some of their practices around music streaming exclusivity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the walled gardens between Tencent and Alibaba <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-and-tencent-consider-opening-up-their-walled-gardens-11626259544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be removed to some extent</a>, which should benefit both of them and Chinese consumers in general in the long run. Historically, these two mega-corporations carved out separate non-interoperable systems, and so for example Alibaba doesn’t accept Tencent’s payment system for its online marketplaces, even though hundreds of millions of people use Tencent’s payment system. The two firms are in talks to open this up, allowing Tencent’s payment system to be used in Alibaba marketplaces, and for Alibaba’s businesses to be able to make use of Tencent’s social media platforms.</p>
<p>Another ironic outcome of this crackdown might be that Tencent and Alibaba could get even more opportunities to invest in Chinese startups at attractive valuations as long as they don’t take controlling interests and run afoul of regulators. If China indeed makes it harder for Chinese companies to gather foreign capital via IPOs, then some of the giant domestic pools of capital should increase their importance and get access to better deals overall, since some of their foreign competition would dry up. Tencent in particular is a massive investor in Chinese startups, many of which have gone on to become major companies:</p>

<p>So, it remains to be seen how this will shake out, but my expectation is that after the dust settles for the credit tightening and regulatory crackdown this year, China’s tech sector has another big round of growth ahead. I wouldn’t want to invest in companies that I believe have their fundamental business threatened, nor would I want to invest too heavily in China in general, but for historically cheap and structurally important Chinese mega-caps who are being slapped on the wrist and told to reform some of their anti-competitive practices, I still consider that to be investable with a modest position. Call it an informed speculation, perhaps.</p>
<p>There’s more regulatory risk with China than most other large markets, but on the other hand, investing in equivalent US companies comes with much higher valuations, and they have increasing regulatory scrutiny as well. So, while I consider Chinese mega-caps to be risky in a vacuum, I still think that a sampling of them within an otherwise diversified portfolio actually reduces total risk slightly.</p>
<p><strong>Tail Risk Analysis</strong></p>
<p>With Chinese companies, investors have a few tail key risks besides the risks associated with their underlying businesses.</p>
<p>One tail risk is the VIE structure, which stands for Variable Interest Entity. Because China prevents foreigners from owning chunks of its companies, there has been a history of companies forming offshore companies that let foreigners own part of the company by contract proxy. If the US and China were to ever go full-on cold war with each other and burn capital bridges, China could null those contracts.</p>
<p>A second tail risk is the accounting quality. China doesn’t let US firms audit Chinese corporate books. However, they let the Hong Kong arm of major auditors, like PwC, audit their books. Accounting fraud is unfortunately pretty common in Chinese equities, although most investors consider the mega-cap ones to have a lower risk of fraud. However, if it comes to light that the numbers are not what they say they are, that could be a massive blow to the stock prices of those companies.</p>
<p>A third tail risk is simply ongoing regulatory crackdown. My base case is that this crackdown will end by next year, and that the Chinese economy and major tech stocks will resume another leg higher. In other words, I think Chinese regulators are trying to clean house, fix some anti-competitive practices and data issues (even though I wouldn’t agree with the way they go about some of it), and get a handle on their payment systems as they role out CBDCs, rather than go full-on communist. However, if bears are correct and China just structurally throws out its half-capitalist/half-communist playbook and leans heavy towards the communist side, then these companies are less likely to prosper.</p>
<p>For that reason, I continue to like a handful of structurally important Chinese tech companies, and expect a big leg up over the next several years. However, I maintain smaller position sizes than I would if these were American or European companies with the same metrics.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>There has been a quiet bull market in Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and the broader healthcare sector. BMY has broken above its 2019/2020 highs in recent weeks, and if it can clear $70 then it will be at 5-year highs:</p>

<p>For the 2020s decade, the company has a mix of patent expirations and a strong pipeline to offset those expirations, largely thanks to its massive acquisition of Celgene that it is currently digesting and deleveraging from. At a time when the economic cycle is in unclear territory with broad US stock market valuations at near-record highs, BMY’s free cash flow business with low valuations remains appealing in my view:</p>

<p>I remain pretty bullish on defensive equities at this time, such as healthcare stocks, high-quality midstream assets, and profitable growth stocks. Some of the beaten-down stocks in Asia and Latin America look interesting, and I continue to maintain a globally diversified portfolio.</p>
<p>Markets seem to be past a lot of the speculative meme-stock mania, especially as stimulus checks wear off. Fundamentals and business quality matter quite a bit here.</p></div></article></main></div></div>
