<p><b>Does Peter have patients stop taking their supplements before doing their lab tests?</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Peter actually prefers that patients ARE taking the supplements that they typically take</span></li>
<li><span>In fact, he will postpone lab work to allow for a person re-continue taking a supplement that they may have run out of</span></li>
<li><span>For example, if a person is taking methylated B vitamins because they have high homocysteine, we wouldn’t want to run lab tests if they ran out of their supplement — we’d want to see their labs with the supplement to make sure it’s keeping homocysteine down</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The more important point</b><span>: You need to know how long it takes to see the effect of the intervention</span></p>
<p><span>For example, one of the longer tail things is looking at </span><a href="https://omegaquant.com/what-is-the-omega-3-index/" target="_blank"><span>omega-3 index</span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The </span><a href="https://omegaquant.com/" target="_blank"><span>Omega Quant test</span></a><span> looks at the red blood cell membranes and measures the amount of EPA and DHA (Omega 3 fatty acids)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Your index number rises with increase fish consumption and/or taking fish oil supplements but it takes 3+ months to fully assimilate the change&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>And if you think that the change is supposed to happen quicker, you could be misled into thinking you’re not giving them enough</span></li>
<li><span>By contrast, with a drug like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolocumab" target="_blank"><span>Repatha</span></a><span>, a few doses would be sufficient to know if the drug is working or not</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>⇒ See </span><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/billharris/"><span>episode of The Drive with Bill Harris</span></a><span> for more on omega-3 fatty acids</span></span></p>

<h2><span>Family history—Questions to ask and what to look for [5:30]</span></h2>
<p><b>Is </b><a href="https://www.23andme.com/" target="_blank"><b>23andMe</b></a><b> data comparable to family history data?</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>“Actually, that pretty much tells me nothing . . . this stuff doesn’t mean Jack compared to your family history.”</span></li>
<li><span>With the 23andME data, you CAN look at things like</span>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;i)&nbsp; </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOMM40" target="_blank"><span>TOMM40</span></a><span> gene to assess </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOMM40#Clinical_significance" target="_blank"><span>risk of Alzheimer’s disease</span></a><span>, and/or&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>ii) </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXO3" target="_blank"><span>FOXO3</span></a><span> — a gene </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7366647/" target="_blank"><span>associated with longevity</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>But the genes Peter thinks are important are things that they measure on their own (e.g., MTHFR, APOE, etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Family history data</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Peter gives new patients a large form prior to their first visit</span></li>
<li><span>He wants to know everything knowable about mother, father, both sets of grandparents, aunts and uncles, and siblings</span></li>
<li><span>Cardiovascular disease, for example—does anybody have a history of cardiovascular disease? Did they take any medication for blood pressure, cholesterol? Did they ever have a stroke, chest pain, heart attack?</span></li>
<li><span>Same questions around dementia, cancer, metabolic disease/diabetes</span></li>
<li><span>Next, they prod the answers to those questions to understand context:&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>You may see a family history full of cancer, but then find out that they all smoked three packs a day</span></li>
<li><span>The patient may have a relative die of a heart attack at 50—Is this a case of </span><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/lpa/"><span>LP(a)</span></a><span>? Was this person an alcoholic and heavy smoker?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Looking for patterns</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The more time you spend gathering data, the more likely you’ll understand what’s really at the root of the genetic template that you inherited</span></li>
<li><span>You’re looking for patterns—signature of cancer, dementia, cardiovascular disease</span></li>
<li><span>Example —&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>About </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019483218312781#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Heart,(ASCVD)%2C%20calcific%20aortic%20valve" target="_blank"><span>1 in 10 people</span></a><span> show up with an elevated Lp(a), but the number by itself doesn’t tell you how bad of a problem it is</span></li>
<li><span>We know Lp(a) is bad, but is this a </span><i><span>big problem or just a medium problem</span></i><span>?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>For the patients who have family members with a lot of sub 60 year old cardiovascular events AND elevated Lp(a) — you need to be acting on that in the </span><b>most aggressive manner</b><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>But maybe you can afford to be less aggressive in the case where families have high Lp(a) but nobody’s having any events until their 80s</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span>The purpose of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [12:15]</span></h2>
<p><b>Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The OGTT is a really cumbersome test and it’s not done frequently especially not with the frequent sampling and looking at glucose and insulin like Peter does it</span></li>
<li><span>Pregnant women might be familiar with a simple version of this test when screening for gestational diabetes</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Blood test done before taking the glucose</span></li>
<li><span>Then 75 grams of glucose is ingested</span></li>
<li><span>Two hours later they do another blood draw</span></li>
<li><span>You see the glucose before and glucose after</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How peter does the OGTT for patients</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>75 grams of a pure glucose drink</span></li>
<li><span>Blood draw at time 0 (before ingesting glucose), 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min</span></li>
<li><span>Measure both the insulin and glucose levels at each time point</span></li>
<li><span>Over the 90 minute period, the patient is not allowed to eat, drink, or exercise</span></li>
<li><i><span>Note</span></i><span>: The test has to be considered in </span><b>one data point</b><span>—e.g., if the person hasn’t slept well in the week leading up to the test, or the person was on a very low carbohydrate diet coming into the test and didn’t refeed glucose before—you can misinterpret those tests a little bit</span></li>
<li><span>Side effects:&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Feeling sick</span></i><span> — a lot of patients when infused with that much glucose feel incredibly sick&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><i><span>Paradoxical crash of glucose</span></i><span> —&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>in some cases for patients who are especially insulin sensitive, they’ll experience a paradoxical crash of glucose after the fact because that huge amount of glucose causes such a rise in insulin in the short term because the body is sort of caught off guard</span></li>
<li><span>Their muscle is so insulin sensitive that they see kind of an overcorrection of glucose and they end up hypoglycemic</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><b>Figure 1. Patient A – metabolic test.</b></span></p>
<p><i><span>Observations</span></i><span>: This is somebody with <strong>great metabolic numbers</strong></span></p>
<p><i><span>More about </span></i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin" target="_blank"><i><span>hemoglobin A1c</span></i></a><i><span> (HbA1c)—</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span>HbA1c is trying to estimate the average blood glucose by looking at the amount of glucose that is stuck to hemoglobin—and if you can estimate how long a molecule of hemoglobin lives in circulation, you should be able to convert that to an average glucose</span></li>
<li><span>For example,&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>An HbA1c of 5.0% corresponds to an estimated average blood glucose of 97 milligrams per deciliter</span></li>
<li><span>HbA1c of 6.0% corresponds to an estimated average blood glucose of 126 mg/dL — “</span><b><i>pre-diabetic</i></b><span>”</span></li>
<li><span>HbA1c of more than 6.5% estimates average blood glucose to be 140 mg/dL — </span><b><i>diabetic</i></b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>For Patient A—</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>His HbA1c of 5.1% suggesting his average blood sugar is about 100 mg/dL</span></li>
<li><span>His fasting glucose is 75</span></li>
<li><span>His fasting insulin is 5</span></li>
<li><span>This patient </span><i><span>appears</span></i><span> to be very healthy metabolically, despite some imperfect dietary patterns (e.g., candy eater)</span></li>

<p><span><b>Figure 3. Patient A – Insulin.</b></span></p>
<p><span><em>Observations</em>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Patient A starts with a baseline blood glucose of 75 which is exceptional</span></li>
<li><span>However, it shoots up to 184 and basically stays there for the next hour</span></li>
<li><span>Insulin goes up to 47 which isn’t outrageous, but interestingly, it stays about there until about 90 minutes when it drops to 77&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>The question</span><i><span>: Why isn’t he putting this glucose away? What could be happening here?&nbsp;</span></i>
<ul>
<li><span>He doesn’t meet the criteria for type 2 diabetes under any circumstance, but clearly his OGTT does not look good</span></li>
<li><span>This is a great example of the type of thing you miss when you only look at these fasting labs without what we would call a “provoked test”</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The diagnosis:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Insufficient muscle mass</span></li>
<li><span>Insufficient ability to dispose of glucose through either </span><i><span>insulin-dependent</span></i><span> and the </span><i><span>insulin-independent</span></i><span> methods of glucose disposal</span>
<ul>
<li><span>See podcast </span><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/inigosanmillan/"><span>episode with Inigo San Millan</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Prescribed therapy for Patient A</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>1—Start wearing a CGM</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Peter wants to see how high his blood glucose is getting during the day</span></li>
<li><span>Wants to understand avg. blood sugar (and reconcile it with the hemoglobin A1c) as well as his standard deviation from the average</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>2—Resistance exercise</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>He need to put on some muscle mass</span></li>
<li><span>He could also afford to lose some body fat, however, the way that we want to reduce his body fat percentage is actually put muscle mass on you and “dilute” the fat</span></li>
<li><span>So this is one of those patients that has the challenge of needing to become </span><b>anabolic</b><span> with respect to muscle while becoming </span><b>catabolic</b><span> with respect to fat simultaneously</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span>Why hemoglobin A1c is a relatively unhelpful metric [24:00]</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin" target="_blank"><span>hemoglobin A1c</span></a><span> is a relatively unhelpful number because it is </span><i><span>so dependent on that assumption that our red blood cell lives 90 days</span></i></li>
<li><span>But there are so many cases when a patient has a red blood cell that lives too long or too short relative to that baseline assumption, therefore their HbA1c either grossly underestimates or grossly overstates their average blood glucose&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>In the case of this patient, once he was wearing a CGM his average blood glucose was actually higher than 100 milligrams per deciliter (which was predicted by the HbA1c)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Peter’s personal example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Peter has the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_thalassemia" target="_blank"><span>beta thalassemia trait</span></a><span>—he’s got really tiny red blood cells that stick around for a long time because they’re just less likely to get mechanically destroyed by his spleen</span></li>
<li><span>This leads to an </span><b>overestimation</b><span> of average blood glucose as predicted by his HbAlc</span></li>
<li><span>His HbA1c typically measures at 5.6%, yet his CGM data has his average blood sugar at 95 mg/dL which would correspond to a HbA1c of 4.8%</span></li>
<li><span>Conversely, Patient A has larger red blood cells that lead to accelerated destruction and a HbA1c that </span><b>underestimates</b><span> average blood glucose</span></li>

<p><span><b>Figure 5. Patient B – 8 day sample of CGM data.</b></span></p>
<p><b>Diagnosis and concluding observations:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>This patient is someone who is clearly eating more carbohydrates than they are capable of disposing&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><i><span>*Moral of the story</span></i><span>: There is no one size fits all. There is no number of carbs that is the right number of carbs. There are people out there that can ingest 500 grams of carbohydrates a day. It’s just a question of, </span><i><span>can you dispose of them adequately?</span></i></li>
<li><span>In the case of this patient, the reality of it is with her muscle mass and her type of exercise, she was exceeding her carbohydrate tolerance&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Fasting insulin or fasting BG would not have provided any clues to the underlying potential IR present.</span></li>
<li><span>CGM also confirmed her average BG and standard deviation were above target.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span>“The point of this case is using this OGTT becomes a great flag to see something that you wouldn’t miss.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>*Important points about the OGTT test:</b></p>
<p><i><span>First</span></i><span>, Peter’s preferred ranges are typically more stringent than the “normal” ranges listed on lab results</span></p>
<p><i><span>Secondly</span></i><span>, you can be mislead by results of an OGTT if you take the test while on a low-carb diet/ketogenic diet or you are in the middle of a prolonged fast</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>That could result in insulin and glucose shown to be very high due to “physiologic insulin resistance”—An example would be the body basically shutting down the muscle to accept glucose on account of preparing the body to save as much glucose as possible for the brain</span></li>
<li><span>Avoid this by refeeding carbs for three days before the OGTT to get the system primed again</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>Third</span></i><span>, someone on a ketogenic diet will have much higher free fatty acids&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>This will show up as a bad thing because for someone with T2D they will also have elevated FFA</span></li>
<li><span>But the test won’t be able to distinguish that the keto dieter is just someone who is oxidizing fat constantly</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span>Case study—Metabolic dysfunction and a framework for metabolic health [33:30]</span></h2>
<p><b>Peter’s framework for metabolic health</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Metabolic health is a foundation with 3 pillars that stand on it</span></li>
<li><span>Peter uses this framework to think about chronic disease</span></li>
<li><span>The 3 pillars are the 3 disease states that are responsible for the </span><i><span>majority</span></i><span> of chronic deaths</span>
<ul>
<li><span>1) Atherosclerotic diseases</span></li>
<li><span>2) Cancer</span></li>
<li><span>3) Neurodegenerative diseases</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Metabolic health is the </span><b>foundation</b><span> for which these disease states are set upon</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If the metabolic state of health of an individual is anything other than </span><i><span>fully optimized</span></i><span>, it is going to increase risk for each and every one of the three pillars of chronic disease</span></li>
<li><span>You can think of metabolic health as a continuum with the most extreme state of metabolic dysregulation being unregulated </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes" target="_blank"><span>type 2 diabetes</span></a></li>
<li><span>T2D is a situation in which the patient is completely unable to partition fuel, even at the most basic level, which is to get glucose out of the circulation.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>A person’s risk of the pillar diseases goes up significantly</span></li>
<li><span>Obesity and type 2 diabetes probably represent the </span><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/obesity-and-cancer-768x930.gif"><span>second leading cause of cancer</span></a><span> (second only to smoking)</span></li>
<li><span>And there’s no disputing the relationship that type 2 diabetes has on Alzheimer’s disease and on cardiovascular disease</span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span>“If you want to further reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, atherosclerosis, in addition to doing all of the “disease these specific things,” you must be the most metabolically flexible, metabolically healthy person imaginable.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><i><span>What does that mean?</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You must be able to dispose of glucose really, really efficiently.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>This is why many of Peter’s patients wear a CGM — it’s a tool to be able to see if average glucose is below 100 with a standard deviation below 15 — which gives you a sense of how much it’s cycling and therefore how low you’re keeping insulin levels</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>You can also look at </span></i><b><i>lipids</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A person will sometimes have very high LDL, very high triglycerides and very low HDL</span></li>
<li><span>In fact, the condition of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome" target="_blank"><span>metabolic syndrome</span></a><span> is partially defined by two of those</span></li>
<li><span>Metabolic syndrome that is meant to closely approximate insulin resistance</span></li>
<li><span>It’’s defined by having at least 3 of the following 5 things</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Elevated waist circumference: waist to hip ratio &gt; 0.90 (male); &gt; 0.85 (female), or BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2</span></li>
<li><span>Elevated fasting blood sugar: &gt;100 mg/dL</span></li>
<li><span>Elevated blood pressure: systolic BP &gt; 130 or diastolic BP &gt;85 mm Hg</span></li>
<li><span>Elevated triglycerides: &gt; 150 mg/dL</span></li>
<li><span>And low HDL: &lt; 40 mg/dL for males; &lt; 50 mg/dL</span></li>
</ul>

<p><em><span>Notable observations:</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Fasting insulin at baseline is quite high</span></li>
<li><span>At 90 minutes, insulin is still dramatically elevated</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Thoughts and lessons</b><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>This is a guy who metabolically slips through the cracks in most cases</span></li>
<li><span>You can’t just look at the traditional markers of metabolic syndrome — you’ve got to dig a little bit deeper</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>How the treatment has gone with Patient C</b><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Goal was to reduce inflammation by correcting homocysteine and insulin levels</span>
<ul>
<li><span>It has been stubbornly difficult to correct his homocysteine—He’s got an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase" target="_blank"><span>MTHFR</span></a><span> mutation that has made it complicated</span></li>
<li><span>It took a year to get this patient’s fasting insulin to a normal range</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>CGM became a very helpful tool for him as well on the behavioral front, because he was struggling with some of the things he was eating</span></li>
<li><span>He struggled with some bad eating habits — He runs marathons was mainlining energy goos and such and it took him a while to understand how damaging those foods can be</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span>Peter’s ideal tracking of metabolic health for all his patients [43:30]</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>First, put a CGM on everyone</span></li>
<li><span>He would NOT wait until they fail an OGTT&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>The intervention begins once your </span><b>avg. blood sugar is above 100, or your std dev. is above 15</b></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>Why do it this way?</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Because your CGM metrics start to look concerning YEARS before you might fail an OGTT</span></li>
<li><span>Your HbA1c looks concerning nearly a decade after an OGTT starts to look concerning</span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span>“We literally wait until your hemoglobin A1c is broken, which means by definition your average blood sugar is about 140. By this point you’ve already got impaired erections. You’re already losing your vision. You already doubled your risk of cancer and heart disease and Alzheimer’s. Like we’re going to wait until you got there to say, ‘Oh, we better do something about this.’ It really doesn’t make any sense obviously.”</span></p></blockquote>

<h2><span>Contrasting presentations of hypogonadism—Low free testosterone [45:00]</span></h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/336926305/9be146c683" target="_blank"><span>Video of Peter explaining males sex hormones</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>When Peter says “low testosterone” he’s actually referring to low “</span><b>free</b><span>” testosterone because that is what is acting physiologically</span></li>
<li><span>Peter only treats a patient for low free testosterone when it is </span><i><span>accompanied by symptoms</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>First order question when investigating the cause of low free testosterone</b><span>:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is the problem in the testes whereby the body is failing to make enough? (Primary hypogonadism)</span></li>
<li><span>Or is the problem that the brain not getting the signal to tell the testes to make more? (Secondary hypogonadism)</span></li>

<p><span><b>Figure 11. Patient D – Low testosterone.</b></span></p>
<p><span>*</span><i><span>Note</span></i><span>: This lab was measured free T in picograms per milliliter but it measured total T in nanograms per deciliter. A better comparison would be using nanograms for free T which would put free T at 4.16. So you can now see that free T is only 4.16 of the 234 total T making it just 2% of the total.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Observation from lab</em>: Free T of 4.16 places him well below the lower limit (5th to 10th percentile) AND he’s experiencing symptoms.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Figure 12. Patient D – hormones.</b></span></p>
<p><span><em>Observation and diagnosis:</em>&nbsp;Given that LH and FSH are also at the very bottom of the reference range, this thereby confirms the diagnosis of </span><b>secondary hypogonadism</b><span> (aka central hypogonadism)</span></p>
<p><b>Therapy for Patient D</b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>First line of therapy—</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Fix his sleep, nutrition, and alcohol to get LH and FSH high enough to actually get his testosterone higher</span></li>
<li><span>After 9 months, Patient D’s LH and FSH doubled, however, his free testosterone levels did not go up enough</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Second line of therapy—</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Next, Peter prescribed Clomid—a drug that tells the hypothalamus, to tell the pituitary, to make more FSH and LH by basically tricking it with respect to estradiol levels</span></li>
<li><span>Patient D is currently in the second line of therapy and being monitored</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Last line of therapy—Exogenous testosterone&nbsp;</span></p>

<li><span>Secondly, make sure he’s not turning too much of his testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (52) or estradiol (45)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Possible treatment approaches:</b></p>
<p><span>1-One approach is you can block some of the conversion to estrogen—but when the estrogen is only 45 that doesn’t make a lot of sense b/c you also run the risk of having the estrogen too low</span></p>
<p><span>2-Another approach is you can block the conversion of testosterone to DHT using 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors—but if they’re not symptomatic from that (e.g., enlarged prostate or hair loss), it might not be the best approach given those drugs can come with some </span><i><span>sexual side effects</span></i></p>
<p><span>3-For Patient E, the first order attempt would be to </span><b>replace the DHEA-S</b><span> which is only at 73—if you have more of the building block for testosterone, will you make more of it?&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Peter tried this approach with patient DHEA but it didn’t really do anything</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>4-Next, you can try an injectable form of testosterone called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone_cypionate" target="_blank"><span>testosterone cypionate</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li><span>For Patient E, Peter started with </span><i><span>100 mg per week</span></i></li>

<p><span><b>Figure 14. Patient E – after treatment.</b></span></p>
<p><i><span>Observations:</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Peter says that they “overshot” with that dose</span></li>
<li><span>His total T and Free T numbers were “supraphysiologic” which is not the intended goal</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>More technical notes for those interested</span></i><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>His LH and FSH of course became unmeasurable and his sex hormone binding globulin fell to 30</span></li>
<li><span>What’s neat from a physiology standpoint is… his sex hormone binding globulin started at 87 (why he started out with a free T that was only 1% of his total T)</span></li>
<li><span>He also had a relatively high estradiol, so in anticipation of his estrogen going through the roof once he was given injections they put him on an estrogen blockage — “</span><i><span>but we kind of overdid it.</span></i><span>”</span></li>
<li><span>His estradiol ending up falling below 25 and with it, his SHBG fell to 30—that’s why his free T went up to 2.5% of his total T (from only 1% pre-treatment)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Clinical outcome after treatment</strong> (all that really matters):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Reduced body fat percentage</span></li>
<li><span>Increased in strength from strength training&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Improved libido/sex drive</span></li>
<li><span>Improved mood – blunted response to stressors from work</span></li>
<li><span>Testicular atrophy (Did not cycle him on/off — he wanted to stay on this as he had no concerns with the long term impact of that as it pertained fertility)</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span>How sleep, exercise, and alcohol affect testosterone levels? [56:20]</span></h2>
<p><b>Alcohol</b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Alcohol negatively impacts testosterone levels indirectly most clearly through the damage it does to sleep quality</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sleep&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Sleep is such an important part of hormone synthesis at the pituitary level&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Managing sleep quality and quantity is of utmost importance:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Blue light blockers</span></li>
<li><span>Reduction of cortisol at night</span></li>
<li><span>Less alcohol consumption</span></li>
<li><span>Less late-night eating</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Sleep is especially important in the cases of secondary hypogonadism</span></li>
<li><span>The association with low testosterone and low sleep is not trivial, </span><i><span>but it’s not clear which one’s causing the other</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Exercise and muscle mass</b></p>
<p><span>“</span><i><span>I don’t think that muscle mass gets enough attention in the longevity literature</span></i><span>”, says Peter</span></p>
<p><span>When an older person puts on more muscle—</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>They are less likely to fail and break a hip</span></li>
<li><span>They also may experience a higher quality of life through greater activities of daily living&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Using testosterone to aid in muscle mass—</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Peter says it’s clear at this point that testosterone supplementation </span><i><span>does not </span></i><span>increase the risk of prostate cancer</span></li>
<li><span>And if it does increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, it’s in the most minor way imaginable</span></li>
<li><span>When you consider the longevity benefits of muscle mass aided by testosterone supplementation, you can make the case that the benefits outweigh any potential downsides related to chronic diseases</span></li>

<ul>
<li><span>Peter says, “what’s mind boggling to me is this is a woman who basically six months earlier had all of these hormones.”</span></li>

<li><span>She was “unquestionably the most difficult patient that I have ever had to alleviate symptoms of menopause through”</span></li>

<p><span><b>Figure 20. Patient G – Thyroid numbers.</b></span></p>
<p><span><em>Observations</em>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>TSH is a tab above normal</span></li>
<li><span>Ratio of free T3 to reverse T3 is below 0.2</span></li>
<li><span>Going back in time, her TSH and her ratio of free T3 to reverse T3 has alway been in this range</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Why? ⇒ Probably due to her nutrition—She doesn’t eat many calories would could impact her reverse T3</span>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Side note</span></i><span>: This is pretty normal when fasting—as you restrict calories, the body tries to compensate by slowing metabolic rate and the best tool it has to do that is raising reverse T3, which basically just means shuttling more T4 into reverse T3 than free T3</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Possible therapeutic options</b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span><em>*Peter makes the following important point</em>: Before using lipid lower agents to treat elevated LDL and ApoB, you should first use the right versions of T4, T3 to fix the hypothyroidism</span></p>
<p><span>Looking specifically at “Patient G”—</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Peter is debating whether it makes sense to intervene and try to lower her LDL cholesterol and ApoB</span></li>
<li><span>It’s not clear as to if they should treat this for 2 main reasons: 1) </span><b>Her calcium score is zero</b><span>, and 2) She doesn’t have any </span><b>symptoms</b><span> of hypothyroidism even though her thyroid numbers aren’t perfect</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>But what if her</span></i><b><i> calcium score was positive</i></b><i><span> (say at 100)?</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Given her LDL and ApoB is elevated, “</span><i><span>anybody would jump all over treating</span></i><span>”</span></li>
<li><i><span>Where you’d make a mistake</span></i><span> in this patient is if you tried to correct LDL and ApoB with lipid lowering agents instead of first using the right versions of T4, T3 to fix the hypothyroidism</span></li>
<li><i><span>So had she had a positive calcium score</span></i><span>, Peter would have done the following—</span><b>A low dose of T4 and a reasonable dose of T3</b><span> because of the high reverse T3.&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Typically if a patient has high reverse T3 and you </span><i><span>just </span></i><span>give them T4, you’re just giving them more T4 substrate to make more reverse T3 (which could make the problem worse)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>Peter’s main point—</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Make sure you’re always paying attention to thyroid function</span></li>
<li><span>He likes to see TSH below 2 if someone’s got lipid issues that you want to treat</span></li>

<p><span><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>This is a pretty unusual response to just lowering uric acid</span></li>
<li><span>But it’s also a </span><b>great teaching point</b><span>—</span>
<ul>
<li><b>Do NOT go after blood pressure until you’ve got the uric acid below 5</b></li>
<li><span>Only then start playing with the blood pressure medication&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>*The broader point</b><span>: Try to fix the </span><i><span>insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome</span></i><span> first (which in this case he didn’t have, but he did have the elevated uric acid) </span><b><i>before</i></b><span> you introduce drugs to treat blood pressure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>What determines uric acid levels?</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Things that can drive up uric acid levels include:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>People who eat foods with lots of DNA and RNA (i.e., protein sources)</span></li>
<li><span>Yeast in the beer</span></li>
<li><span>Fructose</span></li>
<li><span>But the biggest part may be </span><b>genetics</b><span>, says Peter ⇒ “</span><i><span>I don’t know why it is that in some patients you can remove all of the normal impediments to normal uric acid metabolism and it’s still elevated.</span></i><span>”</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>For Peter personally—</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Despite eating and exercising well, he can’t get his uric acid below 5.5 without using </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8610/allopurinol-oral/details" target="_blank"><span>allopurinol</span></a></li>
<li><span>He has a family history of hypertension</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><i><span>Peter’s internal standard for blood pressure</span></i><span>: </span><b>Below 120/80</b><span> without producing any symptoms of lightheadedness</span></p>
