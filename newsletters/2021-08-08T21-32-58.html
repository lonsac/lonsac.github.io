<h1 id="toc_0">Stages of Fasting</h1>

<h2 id="toc_1">Anabolic</h2>

<p>0-4 hours</p>

<p>1 Food breaks down into glucose, amino
acids, and fatty acids.</p>

<p>2 Leptin increases and ghrelin
decreases.</p>

<p>3 Pancreas secretes insulin.</p>

<p>4 Insulin shuttles nutrients into cells to
be stored as glycogen, fat, muscle, or
used as energy.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Summary</h3>

<p>Primary fuel source: glucose from your
previous meal.</p>

<p>Between 0 and 4 hours, your body is still
going through the process of ingesting and
storing the last thing you ate. After your
body breaks down carbs, protein, and fat
into glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids,
your body metabolizes them for energy or
stores them for later use. Depending on the
last thing you ate before starting your fast, a
few different hormones could be at play in
your bloodstream.
### Deep Dive</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve eaten a meal heavy in
carbohydrates, you&#39;ll have a lot of glucose in
your bloodstream. That means a rise in
insulin. Your pancreas secretes insulin to
help shuttle glucose into cells where it can
immediately be used for energy production
or stored for later use, either as glycogen
(the short-term storage of glucose) or as fat
(long-term storage). Four hours after your
last meal, glucose and insulin have most
likely returned to “normal” pre-meal levels.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll also experience a fluctuation in ghrelin
and leptin. Ghrelin, the “hunger hormone” is
what turns on your appetite. Leptin does the
opposite. After a meal, your ghrelin levels
fall and your leptin levels rise, signaling to
your brain that you&#39;re full.</p>

<p>The 0-4 hour time frame is what we call an
anabolic, or growth period since nutrients
are available and the body can burn them,
build muscle with them, or store them. It’s
essential for long term health to balance
cellular growth with cellular breakdown and
cleanup. The prevalence of snacking and
frequent meals, however, mean most people
spend the bulk of our waking hours (and
some of our sleeping ones too) in this
anabolic state.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Catabolic</h2>

<p>4-16 hours</p>

<p>1 Blood glucose continues to drop.</p>

<p>2 Release of insulin is low, but release of
glucagon starts to rise.</p>

<p>3 Glucagon triggers liver glycogen
breakdown.</p>

<p>4 Suppression of mTOR “opens the door”
for autophagy.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Summary</h3>

<p>Primary fuel source: glucose from liver
glycogen and fatty acids from fat stores.</p>

<p>During the 4-16 hour phase, your body
switches to the catabolic, or breakdown,
state where stored nutrients including
glycogen and fat are put to use. Once blood
glucose and insulin levels drop, your
pancreas will release glucagon—a catabolic
hormone that stimulates the breakdown of
glycogen (stored glucose) for energy. Since
glucose is still a prominent fuel source in
this phase, your metabolism will attempt to
break down enough glycogen to keep your
blood glucose in the “normal” range (about
70-99 mg/dL).</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Deep Dive</h3>

<p>Glucose is still your primary, preferred fuel
source, but when your glycogen reserves
are nearing empty, you&#39;ll start using fat
stores and ketone bodies to make up the
difference. The exact time that your body
starts shifting from using glucose to fat and
ketones for energy depends on how much
glycogen you&#39;ve got stored away and how
much energy you&#39;re burning throughout the
day. This switch happens faster if you&#39;re
exercising since you&#39;ll burn through your
glycogen stores more quickly; it happens
slower if you have compromised metabolic
health (i.e. insulin resistance).</p>

<p>As your body exits the “anabolic state” you
begin to make room for cellular cleanup, a
process known as autophagy. This is the
process by which cellular debris are
disposed of, and worn-down cellular
components are recycled. Animal studies
have demonstrated the value of autophagy
in protecting against age-associated
dysfunction in important organs including
the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, and pancreas.
The process isn’t yet well-studied in
humans, but we do know that autophagy is
diminished by the presence of growth
factors in the anabolic state.</p>

<p>One particular growth regulator, the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR),
has a prominent role in the switching back
and forth between an anabolic state and
autophagy. The switch activity of mTOR is
largely influenced by nutrient intake,
particularly protein, but also other nutrient
and growth factors including glucose and
insulin. AS you enter a catabolic state,
fasting diminishes all of these signals. While
there is always some level of autophagy
taking place in your body, suppression of
mTOR opens the door for a much higher rate
of cellular cleanup.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Fat Burning</h2>

<p>16-24 hours</p>

<p>1 Asglycogen becomes depleted,
glucose from gluconeogenesis starts
to rise.</p>

<p>2 Lipolysis breaks down fat stores.</p>

<p>3 Fatty acids are mobilized for energy.</p>

<p>4 The liver begins to synthesize ketones
from excess energy produced from
fatty acid oxidation.</p>

<p>5 AMPK activity promotes autophagy.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Summary</h3>

<p>Primary fuel source: fatty acids from fat
stores and glucose from gluconeogenesis.</p>

<p>Your body is switching into fat-burning
mode now. In this zone, your body still uses
glucose (in fact, it will always use some
amount of glucose!), but it is now
significantly more dependent on fatty acids
for fuel. Glycogen is significantly depleted,
so your body produces glucose through a
process called gluconeogenesis while fat
cells release free fatty acids through a
process called lipolysis. In the liver, overflow
from fat oxidation is transformed into
ketone bodies.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">Deep Dive</h3>

<p>Between 16 and 24 hours, blood glucose
levels will be reduced by about 20%. At this
point, fatty acids from fat oxidation become
your primary fuel source, but your brain still
needs glucose to function. With your
glycogen stores tapped, your body makes
glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like
lactate, glycerol, and amino acids through
gluconeogenesis. Yes, your body can
actually make sugar out of protein. In this
zone, your glucose production from
gluconeogenesis increases from
approximately 50 g/d to around 100 g/d.
Most of this glucose is used by the brain
while the rest of your body switches over to
fat for fuel.</p>

<p>Decreasing levels of glycogen and insulin
trigger activity of an energy-sensing protein
called adenosine monophosphate kinase
(AMPK), which further promotes the
activation of autophagy. So you&#39;ve taken
the brakes off of autophagy by reducing
mTOR, and now you&#39;ve started to press the
gas pedal. Things really start to speed up
from here as the presence of AMPK further
inhibits mTOR.</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Ketosis</h2>

<p>24-72 hours</p>

<p>1 Liver glycogen stops being a source of
glucose.</p>

<p>2  Gluconeogenesis reaches its peak and
begins to drop off.</p>

<p>3 Blood ketones increase; BHB is usually
0.5-2 mM.</p>

<p>4 Total ghrelin output decreases.</p>

<p>5 Diminished growth signals and
increased AMPK activity further
promote autophagy.</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">Summary</h3>

<p>Primary fuel source: fatty acids and ketone
bodies plus glucose from gluconeogenesis.</p>

<p>You are now entering a multi-day fast.
Between 24 and 72 hours, you rely more and
more on fat and ketone bodies for fuel. Your
body will prioritize burning fatty acids,
sparing ketone bodies to be used by the
brain. Any remaining liver glycogen will be
fully used up. Glucose production from
gluconeogenesis peaks shortly after the 24
hour mark at around 150 g/d and then drops
off, settling around 80 g/d after 48 hours.
As ketosis gets underway, levels of ketone
bodies in your blood will begin to elevate
indicating you&#39;re in a state of “fasting
ketosis.”</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Deep Dive</h3>

<p>“Ketone bodies” refer to three distinct types
of molecules: acetone, acetoacetate, and
beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Your body can
use both acetoacetate and BHB for energy
production. Blood ketone meters, which you
may have seen people use while fasting or
on a ketogenic diet, measure BHB levels in
the blood. Throughout the third day of a
fast, ghrelin levels (particularly the form of
ghrelin thought to be influential for appetite)
tend to be consistently low, about as low as
after a meal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note here the difference
between ketosis (a natural metabolic
pathway that allows you to burn ketones for
fuel) and ketoacidosis (dangerously acidic
blood from overly high ketone levels, usually
only seen in alcoholics, diabetics, and cases
of extreme starvation). Ketoacidosis
normally occurs only when both blood
glucose and blood ketone levels are
elevated, which is unlikely to occur during a
fast. BHB levels will vary based on the
individual, but within 24-72 hours of fasting,
you&#39;re likely to see BHB levels rise to
somewhere between 0.5 - 2.0 mM, safely in
the “fasting ketosis” range.</p>

<p>With diminishing nutrients and growth
factors like protein, glucose and insulin
along with increased AMPK activity,
autophagy is able to ramp up its process of
cellular cleanup.</p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Deep Ketosis</h2>

<p>72+ hours</p>

<p>1 Liver continues to produce ketones
which become the primary fuel for the
brain.</p>

<p>2  IGF-1 levels are low, as is glucose and
circulating insulin.</p>

<p>3 BHB production increases.</p>

<p>4 Total ghrelin output remains lower
than baseline.</p>

<p>5 Autophagy accelerates.</p>

<p>Primary fuel source: ketone bodies and fatty
reTer(e ion</p>

<p>You are now in the Prolonged Fasting Zone.
After day 3, glucose and insulin levels
remain low, hunger stays suppressed, and
you&#39;re in a steady state of physiological
ketosis. You&#39;ll also see a decrease in
something called IGF-1 (insulin-like growth
factor). IGF-1 is a hormone involved in
growth and development. When nutrients
are restricted, your liver decreases its IGF-1
production.</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">Deep Dive</h3>

<p>Fasting for 3+ days has been shown to
decrease circulating insulin and glucose by
30% or more, which can contribute to
decreased risk of metabolic disease. Blood
BHB will continue to elevate. One study
showed that BHB levels will eventually
plateau between 5-6 mM by day 20-25 of
fasting. (NOTE: If you&#39;re contemplating an
extremely long fast, it’s worth consulting
with a medical professional to make sure
you&#39;re doing so safely.) As your BHB levels
rise, your hunger should diminish. A 2020
review of the scientific literature showed a
correlation between elevated BHB levels
and lower levels of hunger, although the
underlying mechanisms are currently
unknown.</p>

<p>Inhibiting IGF-1 is another step toward
taking the brakes off your cellular cleanup
process. This deep into your fast, all the
nutrients and growth signals that inhibit
autophagy continue to diminish until they
reach a plateau.</p>
