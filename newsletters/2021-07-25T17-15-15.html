      <p dir="ltr">I was talking to some friends last month and I asked what regrets they had over the last eighteen months. To a rule, they all said they wished they'd used the quieter time, the work from home time, to get more reading in. I'm proud of <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=8de57e7863&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">the stack of books I've read during the pandemic</a>, but I know it could have been higher had I spent less time doom scrolling and less time on Zoom calls. But whatever your habits were, remember: You still have a choice about what you make your 'new normal' look like going forward. So what will it be?</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Two recommendations from last month turned out to be rather appropriate. I raved about Michael Lewis's <strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=f675ba8420&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Premonition: A Pandemic Story</a> </em></strong>and John Barry's <strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=4aa147967e&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Great Influenza</a></em></strong>, which have both been very popular at my bookstore, <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=429c31f0ba&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Painted Porch</a>. Days later, we found ourselves in the middle of <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=c5f03c796c&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">a national media story</a>, after <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=69570226ea&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">a very angry letter from a lady who was upset about our mask policy</a> at the store (which we have because our kids are not of age and our county is only 40% vaccinated.) Other nice people followed up by bombing our Google Reviews and letting us know they are looking forward to the day we go out of business. What a time to be alive! Certainly ties into a lovely book I read several years ago and like recommending in the shop:<em> </em><strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=1cc6d31dc3&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Death of Expertise</a></em> by Tom Nichols. </strong>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And then there was another controversy in Texas, in which a wonderful book by three friends of mine, <em><strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=a4fb2bbb22&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Forget the Alamo: The Rise and Fall of an American Myth</a></strong></em>, was <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=5580c81e67&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">banned by the direct intervention of Texas' Lt. Governor</a> (lol cancel culture?!). We're quite happy to carry this book and I am proud to recommend it. History is not supposed to tell you what you want to hear. It's supposed to be challenging. We get better by wrestling with difficult topics.</p>

    <br/>
    This was a book I read several years ago and after my conversation with <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=5b8fb4c4f4&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Kate Fagan on the podcast</a> about her book <em><strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=fb65f62bf2&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">All the Colors Came Out</a></strong></em>, I decided to re-read it. Needless to say, the memoir of a father whose precocious 17 year old is dying of a brain tumor hits you differently after you've had kids. Johnny Gunther was not alive very long but happens to have left quite a legacy, and I learned more from him the second read than the first. This is a tragic, moving book that I think many more people need to know about.<br/>

    <br/>
    Funny enough, McCollough's grandson came into The Painted Porch earlier this month. I'd read <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=00a35a1fcc&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">his great biography of Truman</a>, but assumed I did not need to read another TR book. Of course, I was wrong, as this wonderful look at the early life of Teddy (another precocious kid for sure) and his special family was exactly what I needed. It's a great parenting book—it was said of TR that as a child he was taught about the great men of history and decided to be just like that. Isn't that what we want for our kids? If you haven't been to the Theodore Roosevelt birthplace house in New York City, I highly recommend it. I also love <em><strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=16072be5bc&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt</a></strong></em> by Edmund Morris.<br/>

    <br/>
    I love buying old out of print books because you're always surprised. This one I got from Amazon happens to be a review copy sent to the Canadian journalist Jules Elder in 1993.

    <br/>
    I have raved before about <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=e84c64828a&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Weatherord's book on Genghis Khan</a> (which I used in <strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=a37cb3d3a4&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Ego is the Enemy</a>)</em></strong>, but I didn't know this book existed until I saw it mentioned in Sebastian Junger's <em><strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=e92f98d511&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Freedom</a></strong></em>. Then at the ranger station in Big Bend State Park last month, I saw the book in the gift store. INCREDIBLE! Seriously, that's all I can say. A decade and a half of school and maybe 1% of these contributions of Native Americans were taught to us. Weatherford is a master of making poorly understood (or misunderstood) cultures inspiring and relatable. Read this book for sure. <br/>

    Where do all these kids' books come from? I don't know, some seem to just appear on our shelves at home.

So I know you all would truly enjoy it. We built it around one of the key lessons from Marcus Aurelius’ own development: the idea that leadership is less a position and more a process. It includes 9 weeks of custom emails, a community chat area, some live Q&amp;A video calls with me, as well as weekly live deep dives with myself and a new surprise guest each week, including a senior military officer, a pioneering businesswoman, an NCAA head coach, and more. <strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=03d41d4518&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a>!</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:center;">--</p>
<p dir="ltr">With that, I hope that you’ll get around to reading whichever of these books catch your eye and that you’ll learn as much as I did. Whether you buy them at <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=0049e6dcbd&amp;e=cba86b9b7a" target="_blank">The Painted Porch</a> or on Amazon today, or at your nearest independent bookstore six months from now makes no difference to me. I just hope you read!<br/>
  <br/>
  You’re welcome to email me questions or raise issues for discussion. Better yet, if you know of a good book on a related topic, please pass it along. And as always, if one of these books comes to mean something to you, recommend it to someone else.<br/>
  <br/>
  I promised myself a long time ago that if I saw a book that interested me I’d never let time or money or anything else prevent me from having it. This means that I treat reading with a certain amount of respect. All I ask, if you decide to email me back, is that you’re not just thinking aloud.<br/>
  <br/>
  Enjoy these books, treat your education like the job that it is, and let me know if you ever need anything.<br/>
  <br/>
  All the best,<br/>
  <br/>
