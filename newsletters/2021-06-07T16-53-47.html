            <p><span>Amanda Grant Smith is a geriatric psychiatrist with decades of experience treating patients with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In this episode, Amanda shares how she developed a passion for geriatric psychiatry as a means to support dementia patients. She explains how to recognize, define, and diagnose dementia—a process that still remains somewhat elusive. They also talk about the significance of ApoE genotype and compare the various forms of dementia including differentiating between Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body dementia. They discuss the current landscape of clinical trials, the drug pipeline, and talk about a very promising monoclonal antibody directed at amyloid beta that has the potential to be a disease-modifying drug. They conclude with a discussion about how to define “healthy aging” and reflect on how understanding dementia can shape one’s life philosophy.</span></p>

		<p>Amanda Grant Smith is a geriatric psychiatrist with decades of experience treating patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In this episode, Amanda shares how she developed a passion for geriatric psychiatry as a means to support dementia patients. She explains how to recognize, define, and diagnose dementia—a process that still remains somewhat elusive. They also talk about the significance of ApoE genotype and compare the various forms of dementia including differentiating between Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body dementia. They discuss the current landscape of clinical trials, the drug pipeline, and talk about a very promising monoclonal antibody directed at amyloid beta that has the potential to be a disease-modifying drug. They conclude with a discussion about how to define “healthy aging” and reflect on how understanding dementia can shape one’s life philosophy.   </p>   <p>We discuss:</p><p> How Amanda developed a passion for geriatric psychiatry [3:15]; Defining and diagnosing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease [13:30]; Medical tests for dementia and their relationship to clinical symptoms [22:45]; The pathology of dementia, and the role of the tau and beta-amyloid protein in Alzheimer’s disease [33:15]; The significance of ApoE genotype, and differentiating Alzheimer’s disease from Lewy body dementia [43:15]; The evolution of Alzheimer’s disease prevention, care, and medications over the last 20 years [52:45]; Psychiatric support for dementia patients (and caregivers) with depression and anxiety [1:02:45]; Drug pipeline, clinical trials, and major challenges to overcome [1:13:45]; Redefining Alzheimer’s disease and designing effective trials [1:23:00]; The promise of monoclonal antibody treatments for Alzheimer’s disease&nbsp;[1:34:15]; How we should measure outcomes in dementia trials and define “healthy aging” [1:42:30]; How understanding dementia can reshape our life philosophy [1:53:45]; and More. </p>

</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The behavior problems that can occur in people with dementia (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosis) have always been treatable</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>These are common reasons to see people on the geriatric psychiatry unit (e.g., taking apart the ceiling tiles and their apartment to find these wires that weren’t really there)</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>we can control some of these behaviors so that patients can have a better quality of life and caregivers can have a little more peace of mind</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter wonders if the patients typically already have a dementia diagnosis or if the presenting feature of the dementia can be some of these psychotic symptoms so the doctors need to rule out schizophrenia or other forms of psychosis</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Amanda says it’s both</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>When psychosis presents first, patients sometimes get diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar illness or another illness that does not have an onset in the mid-70s</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Have a misdiagnosis for a few years until it becomes really apparent that there is an underlying neurodegenerative process</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter observes that the early stages of dementia can be quite unnerving and some of the behavior might be driven by legitimate and understandable fear that something is wrong</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Amanda says that some people are blissfully unaware throughout the entire course of their illness even in the very mild stages</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>while others are acutely aware that something’s not right and know for two or three years before doctors can find any discernible changes on their testing&nbsp;</span></li>

<li aria-level="2"><span>A critical mass of damage results in cognitive impairment and ultimately higher levels of impairment, such as executive function deficits</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>If amyloid is also accumulating over the years, you could have dementia related to both amyloid and vascular disease</span>

</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A protein closely related to amyloid (“normal amyloid”) is a regular component of blood vessel walls</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The kind that builds up in Alzheimer’s (“pathological amyloid”) is abnormal in length</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>“because it is part and parcel of blood vessel walls, it’s only natural to assume there must be this interplay between the vasculature and the Alzheimer’s side of things”</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>But the relationship is still unknown</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span>“There are some really exciting developments in terms of looking at blood biomarkers including plasma amyloid in terms of potentially having a blood-based test for Alzheimer’s.

</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Lewy body dementia</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>a diagnosis that can technically be made only post-mortem</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>but there is a classic clinical picture that is so compelling that it can be made fairly accurately in the clinic without diagnostic testing&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>classic triad of symptoms that occur within two years of one another</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>Alzheimer’s-like cognitive impairment that can notably fluctuate so that some days they seem good and on others they are very impaired</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>Parkinsonism component where they will often be stiff, shuffle, have trouble rising from a chair, don’t move arms when they walk (but unlike with Parkinson’s, often don’t have tremor with Lewy body)</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>Visual hallucinations (often accompanied by related delusions)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Additional supportive features, including restless leg syndrome and REM sleep behavior disturbances</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>Sometimes spouses will say they act out in their dreams, like punching their spouse</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Both the motor and the cognitive symptoms fluctuate, sometimes dramatically</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>In Amanda’s own experience, time from diagnosis until those patients are either in hospice or incapacitated or dead is about 8-10 years&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>But many of her patients experience a precipitous decline and then hit a plateau for a while and then really drop off</span></li>

<li aria-level="2"><span>Even though the average for Alzheimer’s is still also eight to 10 years, it can be significantly longer</span></li>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Patients come to Amanda in a variety of ways: referred from their primary doctors, self-referred, referred by neurology&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Peter points out the difference this makes: self-aware patients vs. a PCP suspicion vs. a neurologist who has likely made a diagnosis</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Amanda says about half of her patients think she’s a neurologist; they just know she’s affiliated with the Alzheimer’s / memory center</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Amanda’s early career</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Went to USF in 1997 as an intern</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>did a residency in psychiatry and then a fellowship in geriatric psychiatry</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>chose USF in part because of </span><a href="https://marquistopdoctors.com/2018/12/26/eric-pfeiffer/" target="_blank"><span>Eric Pfeiffer</span></a>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>a leader in the field of geriatric psychiatry and Alzheimer’s disease</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>first president of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>runs the Suncoast Gerontology Center</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>finished her fellowship and went to work for Eric in 2002</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>when he retired in 2008, Amanda became the director of the center and principal investigator for a lot of the center’s clinical trials</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>How Amanda’s practice has changed in the past 20 years</span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span>“The thing that’s the same, I would say, is the fear. People are terrified of losing their minds and losing their memories.” —Amanda Smith</span></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Seeing patients at both the older and younger ends of the spectrum</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>More awareness of Alzheimer’s as a disease and treatment options</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>When she first started practicing, there wasn’t much she could do about it</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>People assumed it was a normal consequence of aging</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>There has been success getting out the message that “this is not something that you have to live with and this is not a normal consequence of getting older”</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>People are seeking baseline evaluations and asking about prevention</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter interviewed Richard Isaacson because he runs a prevention clinic at Cornell focusing on the lifestyle modifications and other things that people can do earlier</span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span>“I think that’s the biggest area where things have shifted. I think there’s also a better understanding that people realize that there’s more that we can do, and that early intervention is key.” —Amanda Smith</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Using medications to treat dementia patients</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>People often used to be embarrassed or isolated by this problem; now they understand that medications can slow down decline (and even help in some people)</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>there was one </span><a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2389.2003.51306.x" target="_blank"><span>study</span></a><span> showing that donepezil delayed nursing home placement [59:00]</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>That’s huge even if people are still going to get worse on the medication</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>the majority of Amanda’s patients have some mood or behavioral issue that requires treatment with medication&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>90% of people will have some behavioral issue at some point in their illness</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Often simple like depression rather than a psychotic type issue</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>depression in a dementia patient is just as treatable as depression in a healthy 25-year-old</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Frequently prescribes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor" target="_blank"><span>SSRIs</span></a><span>)</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>some adjustments made for age and renal function and other medications and drug interactions</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>well tolerated and don’t make patients fall</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Amanda tries to avoid </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine" target="_blank"><span>benzodiazepines</span></a><span> like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam" target="_blank"><span>alprazolam</span></a><span> (Xanax) and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorazepam" target="_blank"><span>lorazepam</span></a><span> (Ativan)</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>particularly avoids </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam" target="_blank"><span>diazepam</span></a><span> (Valium) and longer-acting ones because they can increase confusion</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>there is a dramatically high incidence of hip fracture with chronic benzodiazepine use</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>It’s important to use the minimum number of drugs and stop them when possible</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Amanda has seen patients on something like 15 or 18 multiple meds</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>“Old people … collect meds like they collect other things. … You’re like, ‘Why are you even on this?’ … So we do have to be vigilant and really target symptoms with the safest, lowest dose and the shortest treatment period that we can. But in doing so [we] can be very effective in treating these symptoms”</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Someone might have needed 3 medications to manage their blood pressure when they were 50</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>Now they are 90 and falling because their BP is too low</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>No one ever took them off the medication</span></li>

</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span>“We do have to be vigilant and really target symptoms with the safest, lowest dose and the shortest treatment period that we can. But doing so can be very effective in treating these symptoms.” —Amanda Smith</span></p></blockquote>

<h2><span>Psychiatric support for dementia patients (and caregivers) with depression and anxiety [1:02:45]</span></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Amanda guesses that a majority of Alzheimer’s patients receive complementary treatment for depression or anxiety&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Difficult for both patients and caregivers so often “seek help for that more acutely than they will for the underlying condition”</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Sometimes a spouse or caregiver will also become a patient</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>She provides a lot of support and education</span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span>“So I have the opportunity to share their insights with others, … to make them understand that what they’re going through is valid and real, give them pointers and tools and things that they may not have thought of in terms of handling a certain behavior. Just that one little pearl that might make their day easier.” —Amanda Smith</span></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>For example, if they refuse to get a shower, she suggests they offer the person’s favorite snack if they’ll do it</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Caregivers sometimes interpret the patient’s behavior as intentional, and it helps to understand that the disease is making them do it</span></li>
</ul>

<li aria-level="2"><span>“I think those stages of grief apply to almost everything. They’re sort of part and parcel of our existence as human beings is that’s kind of going to happen”</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>With Peter’s cancer patients, once they get to the acceptance phase the residual concern is the amount of suffering at the end and the mechanism of death</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Everyone knows in an abstract way that they’re going to die, “but it’s kind of a vague, fuzzy, foggy thing”</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>But patients in hospice with stage four cancer think about the actual mechanism of death</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Peter thinks “a big part of that is explaining no, actually we might not be able to save your life, but we can absolutely prevent discomfort”</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Amanda explains to patients and caregivers that as they progress, they’re going to have more difficulty with more simple, basic things like swallowing and mobility</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Some of them will die of something else before they reach a terminal stage of dementia</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span>“So we have the conversation, but we also try not to focus on the end game because that’s just miserable. … And that’s one of the biggest things that I see is not focusing on the end, but focusing on the now, because the truth is with Alzheimer’s, that’s all people have.” —Amanda Smith</span></p></blockquote>

<li aria-level="2"><span>~29 are in phase III</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>at a small scale, they’ve shown efficacy, typically against a placebo</span></li>

<p><b>Amyloid-β</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Amyloid-β is made at different points along the cascade&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>the amyloid precursor protein is on Chromosome 21</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>this is why people with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome" target="_blank"><span>Down syndrome</span></a><span> (who have three copies of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_21" target="_blank"><span>Chromosome 21</span></a><span>) almost inevitably will get Alzheimer’s if they live long enough</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>they’re making a third more amyloid than the rest of us</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>But amyloid-β can be made anywhere from the very beginning of our DNA all the way through some of the enzymes that cleave amyloid</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The amyloid gets cleaved at the length of 40 or 42 amino acids rather than the regular length</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Then the abnormal amyloid folds and there are five rolls</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>the plaque itself is a conglomeration of a series of folds in the protein</span></li>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>There are even differences among the antibodies as to what part of that cascade they target</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Normal amyloid is a component of blood vessel walls&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The pathologic amyloid with abnormal lengths of amyloid-β 40 and 42 could be removed with no ill effects because they have no legit function in the body</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>researchers are targeting the enzymes that abnormally cleave amyloid as a potential treatment</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>both </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_secretase" target="_blank"><span>gamma secretase</span></a><span> inhibitors and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-secretase_1" target="_blank"><span>beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme</span></a><span> (BACE) </span><span>inhibitors have been studied, but side effects have been an issue</span></li>
</ul>

<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter wonders if there has been research on using an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisense_therapy" target="_blank"><span>antisense oligonucleotide</span> </a><span>to target enzyme transcription with laser precision&nbsp;</span>

<li aria-level="2"><span>Amanda notes that the downstream effects of various potential treatments are often unknown</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>might cause liver toxicity or cardiac arrhythmias or something else that makes the drug unsafe</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>There are five approved drugs for Alzheimer’s disease right now and a sixth that is a combination of two others&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>But all treat symptoms of disease rather than addressing the underlying cause of the disease</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>It’s encouraging that that 80% of the pipeline is actually focusing on the underlying cause as opposed to just the symptoms</span></li>

<h2><span>Redefining Alzheimer’s disease and designing effective trials [1:23:00]</span></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In 2011, a major milestone occurred when we understood that amyloid pathology building up for many years was a key factor</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Alzheimer’s was redefined&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Some earlier drug trials may have been unsuccessful because they targeted amyloid too late</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>An understanding of the progression through preclinical Alzheimer’s and mild clinical impairment (MCI) allowed us to then design currently ongoing trials looking at prevention by amyloid removal both before cognitive symptoms start and during the MCI period</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Earlier failed studies lasted about 18 months&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Peter wonders if it’s like taking patients who have the most aggressive form of cardiovascular disease and giving them lipid lowering therapy for 18 months</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Did they need to do the study earlier in the disease process and for a longer period of time?</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Amanda says the time period doesn’t matter as much for Alzheimer’s because patients will get worse, but the earlier in disease process is key&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>18 months is standard in Alzheimer’s trials</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Drug development is expensive&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>takes 10 to 15 years and a billion dollars (today maybe around 1.4B) for any one drug to get from development and discovery to FDA approval</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>there’s no question that the United States subsidizes the rest of the world in drug pricing&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>in exchange for having the best drugs available first, we pay a premium for the development of the drug</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>for every one drug that makes it all the way through, there’s literally 4,000 or 5,000 that don’t&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>For Alzheimer’s, 18 months is a spot where progress would be very significant, staying stable would be an improvement, and getting worse means the drug is not working</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter points out that in oncology, there are approved drugs that add very little</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>extend median survival by two months without extending overall survival</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>but cost a hundred thousand dollars&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter notes that patient selection and study design are crucial</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The FOURIER and ODYSSEY trials (1:29:45)</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter says the two major trials used to test the </span><span>proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 </span><span>(</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCSK9#PCSK9_Inhibitor_Drugs" target="_blank"><span>PCSK9</span></a><span>) inhibitors were “very elegant and very complementary”&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28304224" target="_blank"><span>FOURIER trial</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>patients typically had LDL cholesterol &lt; 70 mg/dL (~5</span><span>th</span><span> percentile)</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>taking the maximum dose of a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin" target="_blank"><span>statin</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>added a PCSK9 inhibitor</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>after 2-3 years saw improvement</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>cardiovascular trial outcomes are usually major adverse cardiac events (MACE) – heart attack, stroke, revascularization, and death</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>the point is not the biomarker (how much it lowers cholesterol) but whether it prevents a bad outcome</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1801174" target="_blank"><span>ODYSSEY trial</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Patients equally at risk as FOURIER trial but not “heavily statinized”</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Looked at same outcomes, including all-cause mortality</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Challenges in Alzheimer’s trials</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter struggles to understand the equivalent end points in Alzheimer’s studies</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Very unlike a heart attack, things like cognitive improvement seem subjective and hard to measure</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>it’s a harder disease to measure definitive outcomes for</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>How do you think about patient selection for an Alzheimer’s trial?</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>We know it’s too late by the time a patient has significant dementia</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Amanda thinks there may be opportunity for patients with MCI as well as mild dementia to benefit from disease-modifying therapies&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>But prevention trials are key because you want to stop decline it before it starts</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Based on PET, the outcomes for anti-amyloid drugs are excellent</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>PET-measured amyloid status goes from positive to negative</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>But if the patients aren’t any better or if they’re continuing to get worse, it doesn’t matter</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span>The promise of monoclonal antibody treatments for Alzheimer’s disease [1:34:15]</span></h2>
<p><b>Monoclonal antibodies to amyloid</b></p>

<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>they already had enough neurodegeneration and other brain pathology</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>whether the amyloid was there any more no longer mattered&nbsp;</span></li>

</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The FDA is considering data for </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aducanumab" target="_blank"><span>Aducanumab</span></a><span> right now</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Eli Lilly </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2100708" target="_blank"><span>study</span></a><span> on </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donanemab" target="_blank"><span>Donanemab</span></a>

<li aria-level="2"><span>it met endpoints on almost all of the primary and secondary outcome measures that had been set</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>So although prevention is key, MCI group cannot be ruled out</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Goal is to develop a routine amyloid test everyone would have and preventive measures to avoid cognitive decline</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>hopefully we can model this after a disease where we’ve had unbelievable success like cardiovascular disease, rather than a disease like cancer, which we have to wait until you develop to treat&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>we are on the cusp of “liquid biopsies” (which Peter will discuss on the podcast in a few months)</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Aducanumab studies: EMERGE, ENGAGE, and EMBARK</b></p>

<li aria-level="1"><span>futility analysis</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>company analyzes data to see if it’s worthwhile to continue spending their resources on the drug or to abandon it</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>they were not meeting their primary endpoints</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>After looking at a cohort of people who had dose escalated in the interim, they realized that the people in the high-dose group actually were meeting the endpoints</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>in a very unusual turn of events, they </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(19)30480-6/fulltext" target="_blank"><span>said they were wrong </span></a><span>and the drug was helping</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>they ended up going back and putting people back in the study who had previously been on it in the new EMBARK study</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Data has been submitted to the FDA for approval</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter thinks the highest dose given in these studies was around 10 mg/kg&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Was also a stratification for ApoE genotype</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Peter didn’t understand this because they were giving a lower dose to the ApoE e4 carriers</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Amanda says one of the reasons that they give the ApoE e4 carriers a lower dose is because of the risk of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid-related_imaging_abnormalities" target="_blank"><span>amyloid-related imaging abnormalities</span></a><span> (ARIA)</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><span>with amyloid drugs, often will see changes in MRI, either </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema" target="_blank"><span>edema</span></a><span> (ARIA-E) or micro </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding" target="_blank"><span>hemorrhages</span></a><span> (ARIA-H)</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>in previous studies there was a distinct difference between the risk of ARIA between e4 carriers vs non-carriers</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>Didn’t happen in this study, so amended the protocol for e4 subjects to go to 10 mg/kg</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>On June 7, 2021, the FDA is expected to announce whether it will approve the drug or not</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>There have been conflicting advisory board reports, so it’s unclear what’s going to happen</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Patient and family groups, noting the lack of any new treatment in 20 years, say it’s better for nothing and are pushing for approval</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>If it’s not approved, theoretically Biogen could run another phase III trial with a better protocol&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><span>How we should measure outcomes in dementia trials and define “healthy aging” [1:42:30]</span></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Another issue is that the primary outcome measures for these trials aren’t very good&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Some use the clinical dementia rating (CDR), which has a subjective component based on patient and caretaker interviews</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Prone to bias from, for example, a highly stressed or depressed caregiver who sees everything worse than it is and over-reports symptoms</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>CDR looks at memory, judgment, hobbies, etc., which are reported by the patient and caregiver, whose responses are compared</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>There is also an “intangible part” where a scorer might say it “feels like” a 1.0 or a 0.5 – this is not an objective measure like your LDL level</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter suggests that because subjective evaluation is so important, we at least need biomarkers that are so predictive of clinical outcome that you can rely on them in combination with a clinical evaluation&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You can’t do a long enough study to get hard outcomes</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Two big challenges in drug development for Alzheimer’s disease</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>technical challenge of developing a good enough drug</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>operational challenge of how you actually study it</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Can use different outcome measures like the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAS-Cog" target="_blank"><span>The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale</span></a><span> (ADAS-Cog)&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>cognitive composite score have been used in other trials</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Some critics accused them of cherry picking, but the outcomes were predefined</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>the cognitive composite is based on years and thousands of patients’ worth of data showing what specific cognitive tests may be better predictors</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The ADAS-Cog is very ingrained in this field and although it certainly has a lot of utility, it also has limitations</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Finding better objective cognitive primary outcome measures in addition to biomarkers certainly will be useful for drugs moving forward</span></li>

<li aria-level="1"><span>Aging well is also impacted by how much regret we live with</span></li>

<blockquote><p><span>“And so very often I see people who come in and have worked really hard throughout their lives and put off this and put off that. And we’re just about to retire and do XYZ. And then now, well now I have this devastating disease.” —Amanda Smith</span></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>She tells them they can still do those things, but perhaps differently</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Amanda always wanted a house on the beach where she could see the horizon from her bed</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>“But that’s something I learned from my patients. Don’t wait, don’t wait until I retire to get that beach condo because I might not be able to use it. I’m living now. So do it now”</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>e.g., still take the cruise, but have your loved one wear a tag with your cell phone number</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Peter thinks prevention is the best medicine for chronic disease, but some people will still need treatment&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Exercise is also critically important&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>A “growing body of data shows that even in people who have cognitive impairment or have full-blown dementia, aerobic activity can actually improve scores on cognitive testing”</span></li>
<li><span>intervention trials in both MCI and AD, the </span><a href="https://tools.silversneakers.com/" target="_blank"><span>SilverSneakers Program</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://school.wakehealth.edu/Faculty/B/Laura-D-Baker" target="_blank"><span>Laura Baker</span></a><span> at Wake Forest all show the benefits of exercise even if you already have dementia</span></li>
