      <p dir="ltr">One of my favorite reading pleasures is when you find a book on your shelf that you totally forgot about and pick up and fall in love with. It could be that you bought it, tried it, and it didn't work for you the first time. Or you bought it and got distracted. Or you have read it and it just hits you differently now. There's a great line the Stoics loved—that we never step in the same river twice. Nothing has proven this to me better than books over the years. The books stay the same but we change, the world changes, and something new opens up because of it. <br/>
        <br/>
        One book that did this for me this week was Mason Curry's <em><strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=eb5562df0d&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Daily Rituals: Women at Work</a></strong></em>. I've written about and recommended the first book <em><strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=17535dbbe2&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Daily Rituals: How Artists Work</a></strong></em> (Tim Ferriss has <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=ae427c09c1&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">a great audio edition</a>) and obviously I knew that a sequel existed...because it was on the shelf of <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=66206c5275&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">my own bookstore</a> (one perk is that I can 'steal' from myself now). But for some reason, I hadn't really read it. Quite enjoyed it this time, especially as a parent. Both books are worth reading and lots to follow up from in the bibliography. I just wish Mason could be more prolific like some of the artists he profiles!</p>

        <br/><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=d4054a0cba&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">I loved the excerpt I read of this book in the Atlantic a few months ago</a> and then read the book and had <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=06b7b519de&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">a great conversation with Clint for the Daily Stoic podcast</a>. We can put aside the whole controversy about CRT (which is really just an impossible culture war trap at this point) and all agree that history has been woefully mistaught and misused with regards to slavery and racisim. This was something <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=fae52704c8&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">I talked about in my brief talk to the Texas Historical Commission late last month about a Confederate Monument down the street from my store</a>. The history that Clint so thoughtfully visits and writes about is, in fact, not history but an attempt to hijack history--lies weaponized in stone and marble and text to disenfranchise as well as to flip the finger at the Constitution. Almost every page of this book gives you something thoughtful and heart-wrenching to think about, and I think it deserves--demands--a wide audience. Do read this book, watch my talk and listen to our interview...and pass on a better word, a better story, to the next generation. </p>

        <br/>
        I mentioned that I'd read half of this book in May, but I picked it back up this month (as I'd like to write about the Queen in my next book). I must have just been in a bad mood the first go around or maybe it gets better in the second half. Anyway, I liked it. I do wish there was a more <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=bc00c82787&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Robert Caro</a> or <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=3ebb8b3923&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Andrew Roberts type of bio</a> of the Queen--someone who was less focused on events and more on the why of the person.

        <br/>
        As I've said before, <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=6e6cfcff6c&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">I carry this memento mori coin in my pocket</a> to remind me: You can leave life at any minute. Let that determine what you do and say and think. (I also have a piece of a tombstone on my bathroom counter). Oliver Burkeman's new book illustrates the same point well--we have roughly four thousand weeks on this planet. How will we spend them? How should we think about them? And don't be deceived by medical advancements. <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=c89fd10cc9&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">As I said in my monuments talk</a>, I got to know a guy who lived to be 112.

        <br/>
        I was looking for my book of <em><strong><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=471546259e&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">The Book of Five Rings</a> </strong></em>and found this on the shelf...which I guess I never got around to reading. I wish I had gotten to it when I was writing <strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=13b25361c8&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Stillness is the Key</a></em></strong>, as Musashi is a wonderful encapsulation of the ideas in that book. Not only was he a brilliant swordsman, but also a poet, a writer and a painter. He was also a strategic genius. He's a must-study for anyone in business, art, or leadership. </p>

        <br/>
        I didn't think I had room in my life for another biography of Churchill but I quite liked <strong><em><a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=1774e9fade&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">Churchill &amp; Son</a></em></strong> about Churchill's journey from his own neglected childhood to trying to raise his son Randolph.

I'm always sad to see great men (and women like Queen Elizabeth) struggle to be equally great parents. Of course, the best Churchill book is <a href="https://ryanholiday.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcd3642d86121fbcaa9914228&amp;id=9131ad750c&amp;e=cba86b9b7a">the William Manchester trilogy</a> but I found this book fascinating too. </p>

Please note that because a lot of the books we sell are backlist titles, there can sometimes be delays in stocking/sourcing.

      I promised myself a long time ago that if I saw a book that interested me I’d never let time or money or anything else prevent me from having it. This means that I treat reading with a certain amount of respect. All I ask, if you decide to email me back, is that you’re not just thinking aloud.<br/>

      Enjoy these books, treat your education like the job that it is, and let me know if you ever need anything.<br/>
