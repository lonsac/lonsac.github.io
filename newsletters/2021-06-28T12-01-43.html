<p>This report focuses on macro updates, the recent Fed update, inflation, rates, bitcoin, and then dives into multiple growth and value stocks as I rotate some of the model portfolio holdings.</p>
<p>As a housekeeping note, this weekend I <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/oil-and-gas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a public article</a> on the oil and gas sector, along with a broader analysis of major energy sources. It draws from some of the premium reports I wrote back in October 2020, focusing on Enterprise Products Partners and the uranium sector. The summary is that although we’ll get ups and downs, I remain structurally bullish on oil and gas for the longer-term, due to a combination of persistent demand and lower capex.</p>
<h2>Macro View</h2>
<p>Daily new cases in COVID-19 have been on the downtrend, but that downtrend appears to be flattening out now, and possibly turning back up:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-covid-cases.png" alt="COVID Cases" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-covid-cases.png 683w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-covid-cases-300x218.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" width="683" height="497"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Worldometer</em></p>
<p>India had a very large spike in cases back in April and May, and had a mutation known as the “delta” variant. Different regions of the world have had different mutations of the virus, and India’s was considered one of the worst, with higher rates of transmission and potentially harsher symptoms. That variant is now spreading globally, and has further transformed into what is being called the “delta plus” variant.</p>
<p>One of the tail risks that could derail the global economic recovery would be a variant that completely ignores existing immunity in vaccinated and previously-infected people. So far there hasn’t been one like that but it remains an ongoing possibility. If such a thing were to occur, it could yet again change human behavior and government policies in countries that it spreads to.</p>
<p>Even various waves of the existing variants have affected economies and markets to significant degrees. Japan’s stock market, for example, decoupled to the downside vs the US market starting in April, when Japan’s case count began to pick up (as opposed to the US case count that did not have a wave that time), which resulted in Japanese politicians imposing a third set of lockdowns:</p>

<p><strong>Federal Reserve Update</strong></p>
<p>On June 17th, the US Federal Reserve issued an update on monetary policy. They raised the interest rate on excess reserves by 0.05%, from 0.10% to 0.15%, and they increased the reverse repo interest rate from zero to 0.05%. So, a five basis point increase to both rates.</p>
<p>These rate changes are different than raising the federal funds rate, and were somewhat expected. Mainly, these changes served as a way to ensure that T-bill rates don’t go negative and to maintain the zero lower bound of the federal funds rate, as there is currently an abundance of reserves in the US financial system compared to how many T-bills there are available.</p>
<p>Back in my May 23rd premium report, I discussed the possibility of IOER and reverse repo rates going up:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed has a few options. They can reverse course and renew the SLR exemptions that they let expire, they can tweak the IOER rate or reverse repo rate or other levers by several basis points, they can taper quantitative easing starting with mortgage-backed securities and shift their purchases to the long end of the Treasury market, or they can just keep doing massive reverse repos.</p></blockquote>
<p>I re-iterated this in my premium report from two weeks ago as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed might tweak IOER, might taper their purchases of mortgage-backed securities, but aren’t ready to taper Treasury purchases yet, even with inflation running above their target level.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, those 5 basis point rate tweaks weren’t surprising.</p>
<p>However, the Fed also released a “dot plot” with the meeting, which shows anonymously where individual FOMC members expect interest rates to be in the foreseeable future. In terms of the median, the FOMC is now expecting a 0.5% rate hike in 2023, whereas the median was recently zero:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-dot-plot.png" alt="Dot Plot" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-dot-plot.png 512w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-dot-plot-164x300.png 164w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" width="512" height="934"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: US Federal Reserve, Annotated/Formatted by Lyn Alden</em></p>
<p>I know it looks like alien messages. Whenever I look at a Fed dot plot, I’m reminded of watching the movie <em>Contact</em> where the aliens send radio signals containing pulses of prime numbers. This practice of dot plots by the Fed began about a decade ago, and it’s arguably outdated already. The Fed chairman Jerome Powell even talked down the importance of the dot plot in his press conference when it was released.</p>
<p>In simple English, due to this dot plot, the Fed came in slightly more hawkish than market expectations, not with their actions, but with their forecasts for future actions. Fed leaders on average were previously forecasting some rate hikes in 2024 or thereafter, whereas now they are forecasting two rate hikes in 2023. In addition, some of the Fed members spoke publicly and started to acknowledge that inflation might be more significant or less-transitory than they previously expected.</p>
<p>Markets had a knee-jerk reaction immediately at the announcement, and began pricing in lower economic growth, a flatter yield curve, weaker cyclical/value stock performance, a stronger dollar, and lower gold prices.</p>
<p>Basically, a subset of Fed members are signaling a willingness to try to defend the value of the dollar, and since dollar is the denominator for basically everything, its weakness has in large part driven the asset price rally and economic kickstart over the past year both in the US and internationally. The Fed’s dot plot is only jawboning at this point, since it’s about forecasting actions that might or might not happen two years from now in 2023, without current endorsement from the Fed’s chairman Powell.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the impact to markets was significant, as described in the following sections.</p>
<p><strong>Rates and the Dollar</strong></p>
<p>The US dollar had a sharp bounce after the FOMC statement. It was already firming up a bit but the move after the announcement was quite strong. Short-term real rates are one of the most important variables supporting a currency along with twin deficits, and the market quickly priced in a higher probability of rising rates in 2023.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-dxy.png" alt="Dollar Index" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-dxy.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-dxy-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="439"></p>
<p>This puts the dollar index in firm range-bound territory. It never made a lower low in May compared to January, and so far this bounce hasn’t made a higher high either. Until it breaks firmly below 89 or firmly above 93, its absolute level is not very interesting. However, this rate of change after the FOMC statement was pretty interesting and certainly put some downward pressure on various things. I’m generally inclined to fade it, and structurally I remain dollar bearish as a base case with a multi-year view, although it’s less clear of a call than in 2020.</p>
<p>There are some specific currency pairs that made lower lows during this phase. USDCNY, for example, made a lower low in May compared to January. The USDEUR pair that dominates the dollar index in terms of weighting, however, did not.</p>
<p>Long-end rates and inflation expectations moved down recently as well. They were rolling over pre-FOMC meeting, and have continued that trend.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-rates.png" alt="Treasury Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-rates.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-rates-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="447"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>Treasury rates remain well below inflation expectations, which remain well below current reported inflation levels.</p>
<p>A position that has not done very well in the portfolios is IVOL, an ETF that invests primarily in inflation-protected Treasuries, along with some options to benefit from volatility and rising rates. I added it to some portfolios in February and it is down over 2%, compared to my various short-term bond funds that are mainly flat.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-ivol.png" alt="IVOL Chart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-ivol.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-ivol-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="414"></p>
<p>My February newsletter explained my reasoning with IVOL. Back then, I anticipated relatively high inflation for this spring/summer (which we’re now experiencing), but I wasn’t sure if long-duration Treasury rates would rise or not. So, I bet on both outcomes: I maintained a gold and commodity position if inflation occurs and long-duration rates don’t rise, and I maintained a position in bank stocks and added IVOL in case long-duration rates rise along with inflation. Inflation occurred and long-duration rates didn’t rise, so the former outcome occurred.</p>
<p>I think IVOL could do better in Q3 than it did here in Q2 as the Treasury plans to issue more securities (since they will no longer be drawing down the Treasury General Account). However, the main catalyst for holding IVOL is finished now, so I’m switching that position out for short-term TIPs (STIP). I already use STIP in the No Limits portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Value and Growth</strong></p>
<p>This chart shows the ratio of value equities to growth equities in the large and mid-cap portion of the US stock market. The first one is for four decades, and the second one is for the past year and a half since January 2020. When it’s going up, it means value stocks are outperforming, and when it’s going down, it means growth stocks are outperforming:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-value-growth.png" alt="Value vs Growth" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-value-growth.png 652w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-value-growth-223x300.png 223w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" width="652" height="878"></p>
<p>As you can see, the recent period of value stocks outperforming growth stocks since autumn 2020 is challenged. The ratio made a slightly lower high and lower low recently. Growth stocks have made a bit of a comeback, as the market is expecting slower growth and thus is willing to pay up for long-duration tech plays that benefit from disinflation and low bond yields to sustain high valuations.</p>
<p>There are still some sub-areas of the value sector that remained robust in the past two weeks, like the energy and healthcare sectors, which I remain pretty bullish on as well. Mainly, it’s the financials and the materials sectors that took a dip. Materials are coming off a parabolic commodity price boom, and financials are correcting in the face of a somewhat flatter yield curve. I still generally like the financials sector, but with more selectivity than last year.</p>
<p>My report from two weeks ago focused on some of the oversold growth stocks at the time, Roku and Etsy, and they had quite a run-up since then:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-roku-etsy-pop.png" alt="Roku Etsy Pop" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-roku-etsy-pop.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-roku-etsy-pop-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="447"></p>
<p>The hawkish FOMC news gave these sorts of growth stocks quite the boost. I would have preferred to see them stay lower for a while and allow for more accumulation at those previous prices. We’ll see in the months ahead if we get similarly attractive entry points again.</p>
<p>My longer-term outlook generally still favors value over growth from these valuation levels and general reflationary trends, but I will continue to monitor different stocks and sectors within each category, since there are plenty of gems of all types. Sometimes cheap stocks get oversold, and sometimes even the highest-quality typically-overpriced names briefly come back down to Earth and provide buying opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Global Inflation Checkup</strong></p>
<p>US inflation is running hot, and interestingly it has the widest gap over Eurozone inflation on record. The two regions measure it a bit differently, and some of this difference is due to the timings of base effects, but it is interesting nonetheless:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-us-euro-cpi.png" alt="US Euro CPI Differential" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-us-euro-cpi.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-us-euro-cpi-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="414"></p>
<p>Considering that US broad money supply M2 grew about 32% since January 2020 while Eurozone broad money supply only grew by about 14% over the same period, this difference is not surprising, and perhaps is even lower than expected. Aside from differing base effect timings, the US did far more fiscal stimulus, resulting in a faster uptick in GDP, money supply, and price inflation.</p>
<p>Here’s the year-over-year CPI of some of the major currencies:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-global-cpi-yoy.png" alt="Global CPI" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-global-cpi-yoy.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-global-cpi-yoy-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="464"></p>
<p>China’s broad money supply grew even slower than the Eurozone’s since January 2020, at less than 11%. Their year-over-year official inflation rate is currently 1.3%, not shown on the Y Chart.</p>
<p>Historically, one of the tightest correlations for consumer price inflation is the oil price. Oil is the master commodity that impacts just about everything, including manufacturing, transportation, and other commodities. On this chart, blue is the oil price in year-over-year percent change terms on the left axis, and red is the CPI in year-over-year percent change terms on the right axis:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-cpi-oil.png" alt="CPI and Oil" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-cpi-oil.png 701w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-cpi-oil-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" width="701" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>Because there is a decent amount of OPEC spare capacity and demand is still impacted in several countries along with weak international air travel, the price of oil hasn’t spiked as high as other commodities have this year, even though it is flirting with multi-year highs:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-oil.png" alt="Oil Price" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-oil.png 671w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-oil-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" width="671" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>A big factor for how transitory inflation will be this year and next, will be what happens to the oil price. I’m generally an oil bull at this time, although I have higher conviction over a multi-year view than a near-term view, since the near term could easily be impacted by virus variants and shutdowns at any moment, or OPEC supply decisions.</p>
<p>There are some credible analyst calls for $80-$100 oil by the end of the year, and if emerging market demand picks up while air travel gradually recovers, assuming OPEC doesn’t increase supply, then that is indeed possible. Private sector supply remains rather tight/disciplined. However, it’s very dependent on those details of shutdowns and consumer behaviors. OPEC still has spare capacity that they could dump on the market, and the probability of that starts to increase as the price gets frothy.</p>
<p>As we look out longer, the lack of capex in the energy sector along with structurally rising emerging market demand, should put structural upward pressure on the price. I intend to hold a number of energy stocks for a multi-year period, although if we get a very large price spike this year or next, I would look to trim into that strength.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Note</h2>
<p>Bitcoin continues to show weak price action, bouncing between the $30k region and the $40k region.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-btc-price.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-btc-price.png 648w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-btc-price-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" width="648" height="399"></p>
<p>It briefly broke below $30k intraday and caught a lot of bearish attention for that, but quickly recovered, and that dip doesn’t register on a 6-month chart like this. Right now it’s still in a series of lower lows and lower highs.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin vs Ethereum and Altcoins</strong></p>
<p>Ethereum is facing similar weak price action to bitcoin. In fact, the ETHBTC ratio broke down below recent support:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-ethbtc.png" alt="ETHBTC" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-ethbtc.png 617w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-ethbtc-300x288.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px" width="617" height="592"></p>
<p>Coin Metrics recently had a set of charts that I found very interesting. It’s data I’m familiar with but I haven’t seen it presented in this format before, which made it useful. The first chart shows BTC’s market capitalization compared to the total altcoin market capitalization, including ETH. The second chart just isolates BTC and ETH:</p>

<p>In both 2017 and 2021, the altcoin and ETH peaks came shortly after the BTC peak.</p>
<p>Overall, that’s one of the more bearish indicators for the intermediate term, suggesting that a pretty major top is in place for a while. On one hand, it cleans out a lot of the euphoria that retail investors had for various altcoins, but on the other hand, it also can translate into less enthusiasm towards bitcoin as well. I warned about the altcoin mania right near the altcoin peak in May, since some of the price charts were just unbelievable:</p>
<blockquote><p>So far, 2021 has had an inverse relationship between quality and price action for the crypto space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have lagged Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, and one called Cumrocket in terms of percent price gains. A lot of this is… very bubbly. When Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash, and meme coins are going vertical, it’s a good time to check risk management for the space overall.</p>
<p>-May 9th report</p></blockquote>
<p>The most bullish interpretation for bitcoin is the idea that this post-halving-cycle bull run will follow a double-rise pattern like in 2013:</p>

<p>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/mvrv-zscore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Look Into Bitcoin</a></p>
<p>I remain structurally bullish with a multi-year view as part of a diversified portfolio. Buying and holding a position in cold storage, dollar-cost averaging in, or buying any capitulations that occur, remain attractive ways to establish a position.</p>
<p>However, until it gets back decisively over $41k, it’s not very interesting from a tactical price perspective, and I don’t know if this price cycle will look anything like 2013 or not. Bitcoin is intermediate-term neutral or bearish until it starts to prove otherwise with a series of higher highs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, besides weak price action, there continues to be a firehose of news for the network fundamentals, mostly on the positive side.</p>
<p><strong>Bank+Bitcoin Updates</strong></p>
<p>NYDIG, one of the largest bitcoin custodians, <a href="https://nydig.com/about-nydig/news-press-releases/financial-institutions-can-now-provide-consumers-easy-access-to-bitcoin-via-fiserv-and-nydig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on June 23 that through their partnership with banks and bank software providers, people will now be able to buy bitcoin via their existing banking relationships:</p>
<blockquote><p>Financial institutions of all sizes now can enable consumers to buy, sell and hold bitcoin through their bank accounts via an integration between Fiserv, Inc. (FISV), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions, and NYDIG, a leading bitcoin technology and financial services company. This will enable banks and credit unions to meet growing mainstream interest in bitcoin, retain and grow their customer base, and increase non-interest income opportunities.</p>
<p>An extension of the Fiserv commitment to open banking technology, the integration with NYDIG will allow consumers to manage bitcoin transactions directly within their financial institution’s online and mobile banking portals, providing users an easy way to buy, sell and hold the popular digital asset through their trusted financial institutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>I originally reported about this topic with NYDIG and banks in my May 23 report, so this represents an update to that news. Now, the infrastructure is in place.&nbsp; It will still take time to show up as an option for consumers, and it will depend on the particular banks in question in terms of how fast they roll it out.</p>
<p>Also, note that Fiserv has been in the growth pie of the newsletter portfolio since October 2020. It’s a $70 billion market cap established legacy tech growth stock with a moat derived from high switching costs; part of the entrenched banking system.</p>

<p><strong>El Salvador Updates</strong></p>
<p>Most people are familiar by now with the news that El Salvador has made bitcoin legal tender in the country. There are some updates for that.</p>
<p>The president of El Salvador recently announced that the country is rolling out a government bitcoin/lightning wallet app that is interoperable with private wallet apps since it’s connected to the open source bitcoin/lightning network. Due to an arrangement with the telecom providers, the government wallet will be usable by folks in the country who have a phone even if they don’t have a data plan. When folks sign up for it, they will get $30 worth of free bitcoin from the government.</p>
<p>These apps can be used to send bitcoin to each other instantly over the lightning network, and some of them can quickly convert between bitcoin and dollars. In addition, El Salvador partnered with Athena Bitcoin to gradually install 1,500 bitcoin ATMs in the country, which can be used to convert bitcoin to dollars or dollars to bitcoin.</p>
<p>Overall, the apps should make it easier for folks to pay bills and store some funds, since a large portion of the population is unbanked. All they need is a low-end smartphone, even one without a data plan. Consumers and merchants can immediately convert bitcoin they receive into dollars if they want, which I suspect most likely will.</p>
<p>A politician in Paraguay this week submitted a bill in their parliament to make bitcoin legal tender there as well, following in the footsteps of El Salvador. Some pro-crypto news outlets are reporting this with headlines like “Paraguay set to make bitcoin legal tender”, but in reality, this has a more uncertain path towards passing. El Salvador has a pro-bitcoin president with a supermajority in parliament, and therefore was able to push it through quickly, whereas a member of a parliament in another country submitting a bill inherently has a lower probability of passing.</p>
<p>I do think we could eventually see more small countries follow in El Salvador’s footsteps of accepting bitcoin as legal tender, but it’s important to realize the impediments and timelines of that process.</p>
<p>In similar news, Tanzania’s central bank banned cryptocurrencies back in 2019, but their new president Samia Suluhu Hassan (one of a relatively small percentage of female presidents among developing countries) recently came out positively in favor of research on cryptocurrencies and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tanzania-cbank-says-it-is-working-presidents-cryptocurrency-push-2021-06-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed the central bank</a> to be prepared. The central bank publicly stated that they are following the president’s directives.</p>
<p>The media/analyst consensus used to be that if bitcoin gets too big, it is liable to be banned. So far, as it has become big, a number of countries that were previously banning it or uninterested in it, are now interested in it. It gives them a way to tap into global payments, cheap remittances, and makes it easier to give banking-like services to under-banked populations. It’s the application of open source software to banking services.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s a pretty complex set of outcomes to monitor. Some countries like China are cracking down on it, while other countries are opening up to it.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Mining Updates</strong></p>
<p>China has “banned” bitcoin on multiple occasions over the past decade, and despite that fact, bitcoin persists in the country. By most credible estimates, there are more bitcoin miners in China than the rest of the world combined, despite the fact that China bans it every year or two.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to when they ban Twitter, Google, Facebook, and other centralized systems. Those actually do get removed from the country for the most part, whereas bitcoin is more sticky.</p>
<p>This spring, however, a council chaired by China’s 4th vice premier, Liu He, took a harsh stance on bitcoin mining and trading. This is the highest level that a Chinese bitcoin ban has come down from. In my <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/premium-2021-5-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 23rd report</a>, I discussed the possibility of bitcoin miners leaving China and moving their equipment, personnel, and/or capital elsewhere. It could be “different this time” in other words, and back then there were only initial indications that it might be.</p>
<p>As an update for June, that’s certainly happening. Bitcoin miners are being shut off from power sources, and are shipping their machines, and in some cases their personnel and capital, overseas. Some of it is likely going to Kazakhstan, some of it could be going to Russia, some of it may be going to Iceland, and some of it is coming to North America. Basically, wherever there is cheap electricity and a non-hostile regulatory environment, miners want to go to there.</p>
<p>A number of sources, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/sinocrypto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Zhang</a>, have shared evidence of bitcoin mining equipment being disconnected and shipped:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-zhang-mining.png" alt="Zhang Mining" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-zhang-mining.png 613w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-zhang-mining-213x300.png 213w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" width="613" height="865"></p>
<p>The largest-ever percent drawdown in bitcoin’s hash rate further supports this as likely occurring to a substantial degree:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-bitcoin-hash-rate.png" alt="Bitcoin Hash Rate" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-bitcoin-hash-rate.png 654w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-bitcoin-hash-rate-231x300.png 231w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" width="654" height="848"></p>
<p>The numbers suggest so far that it’s not China’s entire hash rate, but seems to be a big chunk of it. A lot of the largest industrial-scale miners in China are the ones visible enough to enforce the ban on. Some smaller miners can continue to exist there under the radar.</p>
<p>In the short term, this is a big volatility event. Many Chinese mining businesses did not plan for this to happen, and may need to sell or have sold assets including their bitcoin reserves, in order to fund their liquidation or movement.</p>
<p>In the intermediate term, this presents an opportunity for businesses elsewhere in the world who want to get into bitcoin mining or expand their existing mining operations. There will be a lot of equipment for sale, and the bitcoin network’s difficulty adjustment will kick in to the downside to make mining easier for remaining miners in the face of the reduction in hash rate.</p>
<p>In the long term, this removes one of the common criticisms of bitcoin’s network: that it is dominated by China. In reality, the globally distributed node network has always kept a check on the fact that over half of the mining hash rate is estimated to be located in China, but now that hash rate is becoming more geographically distributed, it seems that this criticism will no longer be fundamentally relevant at all. It will, however, take time for this hash rate migration to occur and for us to see what the new geographic distribution starts to look like.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning Updates</strong></p>
<p>In my premium report from two weeks ago, I reported that the lightning network, the secondary protocol that runs on top of the bitcoin base layer, reached 1,500 BTC capacity and is breaking out in terms of usability and liquidity.</p>
<p>Well, less than two weeks later, I can report that the network reached 1,600 BTC capacity, which is a more than 6% increase in two weeks (an over 400% annualized growth rate, although it likely won’t sustain that pace). Here’s a chart of the capacity, and I added an annotation in green:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-lightning-capacity.jpg" alt="Lightning Capacity" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-lightning-capacity.jpg 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-lightning-capacity-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="350"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/kerooke/status/1407463413979172868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Rooke</a>, annotated by Lyn Alden</em></p>
<p>The network had a big injection of BTC in the early phase in order to bootstrap it, but that capacity was not very efficiently distributed to create robust liquidity. So, it settled and stagnated for a while as development continued, and over time it organized itself more efficiently into better and better liquidity. Then, about six months ago, as development continued and liquidity continued to improve, the network’s capacity started to go more parabolic as a critical mass of apps came to the network.</p>
<p>Specifically, a number of popular apps came out over the past year that use lightning, and a number of medium-sized crypto exchanges began using lightning in the past couple months.</p>
<p>For lightning, some channels are private while others are public. Any network has a risk of becoming too centralized, where all of the participants point towards a small number of super-nodes rather than forming a broadly-connected decentralized robust system of normal nodes.</p>
<p>However, the outcome of the lightning network so far is quite decentralized. In the tweet below, Guy Swann runs an algorithmic analysis of the lightning network’s public nodes and channels, and sarcastically points out that it’s far more decentralized than critics said it would turn out:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-lightning-ball.png" alt="Lightning Ball" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-lightning-ball.png 610w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-lightning-ball-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" width="610" height="667"></p>
<p>Chart Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGuySwann/status/1404911947846406145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guy Swann</a></p>
<p>In addition, Documenting Bitcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1405509495262961665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a video</a> that speeds through Github development of the lightning network from the early years until June 2021. The Taproot update to the bitcoin base layer, expected to occur in November 2021, will open up new potential use-cases for the lightning network as well, leading to more development.</p>
<p>When people say bitcoin has no fundamentals, keep this in mind. Countless programmers are working full time to improve the base layer, the lightning layer, various sidechains that connect to the base layer, and the surrounding ecosystem of apps and hardware devices. Usually when people say bitcoin has no fundamentals, they are telegraphing that they haven’t studied it enough to understand it.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean it has to succeed. Every business that fails, has some fundamentals. Plenty of altcoins fail, despite having programmers working on them. Bitcoin also can fail. An investor could study the fundamentals, and decide that it has a low probability of continued success from here.</p>
<p>But the point is, it’s factually incorrect to say Bitcoin has no fundamentals; it has a growing network effect of solutions for various issues, relating to cryptographically storing value, storing information, or making permissionless payments, including fiat-to-BTC-to-fiat payments. My <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/gold-and-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article on bearer assets</a> goes into detail on some of the use-cases, for both developed and developing markets.</p>
<p>For folks who want more news on bitcoin and the lightning network, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxk2vVkna2k&amp;ab_channel=PrestonPysh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preston Pysh’s interview with Alyse Killeen</a>. She’s a venture capitalist in the blockchain space since 2013, and has been heavily involved with funding development of side-chains and secondary layers on top of the bitcoin network’s base layer. There are folks out there who generally just promote bitcoin, whereas Killeen is heavily involved in the ecosystem and doesn’t do a ton of press. She is signal rather than noise.</p>
<h2>Portfolio Updates</h2>
<p>I’m rotating several stocks and ETFs this week, to focus on areas of fundamental strength and attractive valuations.</p>
<p>The full portfolios can be viewed in my Google Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Top 12 List</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletter Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-Sell VNQ (5%). Increase the growth stock pie from 10% to 12%. Increase the dividend stock pie from 25% to 27%. Increase SHY from 6% to 7%.</p>
<p>-Sell IVOL, buy STIP, an ETF consisting of short-term Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS for short.</p>
<p>-International equity pie: Reduce VWO from 36% to 28%. Add 2% each to ILF, RSX, INDA, and ASEA.</p>
<p>-Dividend stock pie: Sell BRK.B and AXP. Reduce AMGN, UL, and USB from 4% to 3% positions. Buy CERN, PRU, and ITUB each as 3% positions.</p>
<p>-Growth stock pie: Sell the 8% position in GOOGL. Reduce ETSY, JD, BABA, FB, AMZN, and HDB from 10% to 8% each. Buy ZM, MELI, PINS, and FVRR as 5% positions.</p>
<p>A number of these stock changes are described in the second half of this report.</p>
<p><strong>Fortress Income</strong></p>
<p>-Defense pie: sell IVOL, buy STIP.</p>
<p>-Individual stock pie: Sell AXP, buy PRU.</p>
<p>-ETF/CEF pie: Sell VNQ, buy AMLP.</p>
<p>Midstream companies have been poor investments over the past decade but I think they are quite well-positioned in the current environment. I like their risk/reward profile more than REITs at this time, mainly due to valuation differences along with a positive long-term energy outlook. However, they are only suitable for a portion of a diversified portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>ETF-Only Portfolios</strong></p>
<p>-Sell IVOL, buy STIP.</p>
<p><strong>No Limits Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-Sell AMGN. Buy 5 more shares of CI, and 20 more shares BMY.</p>
<p>I remain long-term bullish on AMGN and remain long the stock in other portfolios, but I’m consolidating the healthcare picks a bit in this more concentrated portfolio to focus on my two higher-conviction healthcare names at the moment. They have more intermediate-term catalysts for growth during the next 3-years.</p>
<p><strong>Other Holdings</strong></p>
<p>-Sell SCCO and EMX. Buy MELI and PINS.</p>
<p>-Sell VNQ. Buy more SBRCY.</p>
<h2>Multi-Stock and Sector Analysis</h2>
<p>Some of the big rotations in the market since the FOMC statement, keeping in mind the general reality of direct stimulus wearing off, require a renewed analysis of multiple stocks and sectors. In other words, investors must ask themselves, is the growth-to-value rotation finished, or is this just a correction within a bigger growth-to-value trend?</p>
<p>More specifically, are there certain sectors within those broad categories that are better or worse positioned now? The healthcare sector and the industrial sector are both “value” for example, but the former is defensive and the second is cyclical.</p>
<p>So, instead of focusing on one stock in this report, I’m going to look at several interesting sectors and stocks. Some of them may get a deeper description in later reports.</p>
<p><strong>REIT Overvaluation</strong></p>
<p>I’m selling my Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) in the newsletter and fortress income portfolios because many of the stocks in that sector are now quite expensive. And interestingly, although the sector has historically been a “value” sector, the top stocks in it now are mostly cell-tower REITs, data center REITs, and logistics REITs. All of them exhibit “growth” factor qualities.</p>
<p>That could be a great thing, but only at the right price. That’s why I owned the index for a while, but now it’s getting pricey. There are still individually attractive REITs out there, but the broad index doesn’t seem to offer the prospect for outperformance with any margin of safety at the moment.</p>
<p>For example, here is American Tower (AMT), the largest individual REIT in VNQ:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-amt-fastgraph.png" alt="AMT FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-amt-fastgraph.png 970w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-amt-fastgraph-300x179.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-amt-fastgraph-768x459.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" width="970" height="580"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>And here is Prologis (PLD), the second biggest REIT in there:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-pld-fastgraph.png" alt="PLD FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-pld-fastgraph.png 968w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-pld-fastgraph-300x180.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-pld-fastgraph-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px" width="968" height="581"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>These are great businesses, but at 30x annual funds from operation they’re quite crowded now. I’m not saying they’re going to crash or anything like that, but I think there are better places to deploy capital. I’d happily revisit them if prices correct and provide a better forward risk/return potential.</p>
<p><strong>Brazilian Recovery?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Despite the fact that the dollar shot up since the June 16th FOMC statement, the Brazilian real actually <em>strengthened</em> vs the dollar during that time. It’s one of the only major currencies that managed to do that.</p>
<p>Economist Robin Brooks has been pounding the table on Brazil’s currency for a while now (he’s publicly targeting 4.5 BRLUSD, down from a little under 5 BRLUSD currently). The combination of trade surpluses from high commodity prices, and the fact that Brazil’s central bank is aggressively hiking interest rates, is a good mix for currency stability.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-brooks-brazil-tweet.png" alt="Brooks Brazil Tweet" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-brooks-brazil-tweet.png 610w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-brooks-brazil-tweet-216x300.png 216w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" width="610" height="849"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@RobinBrooksIIF</a></em></p>
<p>I agree with his assessment on this one. I’m fairly bullish on Brazil and Mexico at this point. Brazil was one of the hardest-hit major emerging markets from the pandemic, but higher commodity prices helped soften the blow. Those commodity prices are off their highs but likely to remain elevated above pre-2020 levels.</p>
<p>Brazil still has a high rate of COVID-19 infections, and has reported an above-average per capita death rate attributed to the virus. So, there’s still a lot of bad news there, which is a recipe for value investors to find attractive return potential. They have about a 12% vaccination rate at this point.</p>
<p>For investors that want to express a bullish view on Brazil via equities, there are many options.</p>
<p>The iShares Latin America 40 ETF (ILF) has exposure to 40 large-cap companies in Latin America, with a 60%+ weighting towards Brazil. You’d have to be bullish on commodities and Vale (VALE) though, since Vale is the biggest holding.</p>
<p>The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) is one of the longest-running single country ETFs and has a lot of liquidity. The small cap version, EWZS, is also a potential choice.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an investor can buy some individual stocks. The largest bank in Brazil, Itau Unibanco (ITUB) is one way to express a view on Brazil’s economy rebounding and its currency strengthening from beaten-down levels:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-itub-fastgraph.png" alt="ITUB FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-itub-fastgraph.png 973w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-itub-fastgraph-300x179.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-itub-fastgraph-768x459.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px" width="973" height="582"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>There are also Brazilian fintech companies to buy, like StoneCo (STNE). Like many growth stocks, it has corrected recently. It hit over $90 in February 2021, fell to $60, and is now back up to about $67.</p>
<p><strong>Value Stock Rotations</strong></p>
<p>American Express (AXP) is rather hot lately, and a little too hot for my taste. That’s one of the stocks I bought near the March 2020 bottom, and it has gone straight up ever since:</p>

<p>I’d like to see AXP consolidate or correct a bit, and offer a better re-entry point. With that small slot in the dividend stock pie of the newsletter portfolio, I’d rather take some risk/diversification with the aforementioned Brazilian bank that hasn’t recovered much yet, vs AXP that has already gone straight up for over a year now.</p>
<p>Prudential (PRU) is another value stock that I think has more upside potential in this economic cycle, and it pays a better-than 4% dividend yield while investors can dollar-cost average into it.</p>

<p>Like many companies with insurance operations, Prudential has been having a rough time with low interest rates. However, with a single-digit price/earnings ratio and a price/book ratio that is below 1x and below its 10-year average, I think it offers better return potential than bonds or many other investments out there. While Treasury rates might not rise much in the intermediate term, I don’t think we’ll see lower lows any time soon either.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while healthcare IT provider Cerner (CERN) isn’t exactly cheap like Prudential, it is right in line with recent valuation levels with a reasonable PEG ratio, and appears as though it’s ready to break out of a multi-year consolidation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-cern-fastgraph.png" alt="CERN FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-cern-fastgraph.png 968w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-cern-fastgraph-300x183.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-cern-fastgraph-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px" width="968" height="589"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs</em></p>
<p>Cerner is not very affected by the macroeconomic environment, which as stimulus wears off and positive rate-of-change indicators start to relax from their peaks, is an attractive thing to own.</p>
<p><strong>Growth Stock Rotations</strong></p>
<p>I’m selling Alphabet (GOOGL) in the newsletter portfolio growth stock pie. While I’m not bearish on it, I think there are stocks with better forward potential. Alphabet is trading at 10-year valuation highs in terms of price/sales, price/cash-flow, and so forth. It’s up 125% since I added it to the portfolio 2.5 years ago, which is pretty remarkable for a mega-cap stock to do.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-googl-fastgraph.png" alt="GOOGL YChart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-googl-fastgraph.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-googl-fastgraph-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="444"></p>
<p>On the other hand, I’m adding four small positions in growth stocks to the newsletter growth stock pie. These are not fully monetized to their potential yet, so analyzing them is more about topline growth and the eventual path towards maximum profitability.</p>
<p>Zoom (ZM) is an interesting one. It was one of the major beneficiaries of the pandemic, since folks around the world worked from home, and their video conferencing product is one of the simplest to use. The stock reached over $550 this past autumn as a bubble, collapsed to $295, and is now back up to $372. While it remains rather expensive in absolute terms, it’s actually back to the low end of its valuation range, and bounced off of the bottom of that range:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-zm-ychart.png" alt="ZM YChart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-zm-ychart.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-zm-ychart-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="444"></p>
<p>While Zoom’s pandemic-fueled growth spurt is behind them, I think their longer-term growth trend can continue, and they’re expanding into other product lines to become a more entrenched part of the hybrid/global work model. I’m willing to buy a small position to see how far it can run from here.</p>
<p>The management of Zoom has performed very well. Zoom’s founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, was one of WebEx’s first employees, and stuck with the company when it was acquired by Cisco. He pitched ideas that were rejected by Cisco, so he left and started Zoom, and subsequently massively outperformed WebEx with those ideas.</p>
<p>Similarly, Pinterest (PINS) has been in a sideways price consolidation ever since the vaccines were announced in autumn 2020. The company’s global growth continues to be rather robust, and the valuation deflated a bit in recent months as the company’s fundamentals gradually caught up with price. The stock is pricey, but then again, its topline growth is about 2x that of Alphabet’s growth rate so it can support a significant valuation as a fast-growing software company.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-pins-ychart.png" alt="PINS YChart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-pins-ychart.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-pins-ychart-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="444"></p>
<p>MercadoLibre (MELI), the leading ecommerce and online payment company in Latin America, has a similar situation. While it’s not cheap and it’s getting past a pandemic-boosted period of sales growth, its valuation is off its highs and the company still likely has many years of high-growth compounding ahead of it. The market capitalization is under $80 billion, and it’s not too hard to envision MELI becoming a multi-hundred billion dollar company within this 2020s decade.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-meli-ychart.png" alt="MELI YChart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-meli-ychart.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-meli-ychart-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="444"></p>
<p>The $9 billion market cap freelance site Fiverr (FVRR), like many other growth stocks here, is off of its highs but starting to rebound. Forward growth won’t be as high as pandemic growth, but it should still be substantial.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-fvrr-ychart.png" alt="FVRR YChart" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-fvrr-ychart.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-27-fvrr-ychart-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="444"></p>
<p>The biggest risk for these growth stocks in the next six months or so would be higher long-end Treasury rates, perhaps from a continued oil price increase or similar issue.</p>
<p>That’s why I think they are ideal as small positions, with those positions being built gradually. There may be deeper buying opportunities ahead. I remain long energy-related investments elsewhere in the portfolio, which serve as a useful inflation hedge, and overall I retain a value-tilt across the model portfolios.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This remains a challenging investment environment. The “easy” part of the reflation trade is behind us now. As fiscal stimulus increasingly falls into the past, sectors and companies have to stand on their own two feet.</p>
<p>The defensive healthcare sector looks attractive here, since the fundamentals and valuations are attractive, and it has been left behind in terms of sentiment by folks focusing on re-opening and reflation. I also continue to like low-cost energy producers and some of the less-leveraged energy pipeline businesses.</p>
<p>Many growth stocks have fallen out of favor, but the ones with strong prospects for post-pandemic growth are starting to look okay again after correcting for a while and resetting the valuations. I’d honestly like to see some deeper capitulations in them so I am not at a full position in some of these companies.</p>
<p>Wherever possible for growth stocks, I look for “platforms” that benefit from the network effect, and that can generate recurring revenue that grows faster than expenses. This is in contrast to growth companies that rely on individual one-time sales, which I tend to be less interested in unless they meet particularly high thresholds of quality and valuation.</p>
