<h1 id="toc_0">What is Fat Adaptation</h1>

<p>For many people, like myself, that grew up
striving to emphasize carbohydrates in the
diet and eat every couple hours, it is
remarkable that the body is capable of
switching its priority fuel source so efficiently.
Fasters frequently see or hear the term(s) “fat-
adapted” or “flip the metabolic switch”, but
what do these phrases mean? Why might it
benefit you to become more fat-adapted?</p>

<p>Fat-Adaptation: state whereby your body
selectively burns fat rather than carbohydrates
as the priority fuel source</p>

<p>Metabolic Switch: point in the fast when
glycogen balance is reduced and fueling shifts
toward emphasis on fatty acids (usually 12+
hours into fast)</p>

<p>Metabolic Flexibility: distinct ability to utilize
different fuels (ie. carbohydrate or fat) and to
transition smoothly between them</p>

<p>Ketosis: metabolic state where ketone body
concentrations are elevated in the blood to aid
in providing fuel to organs like the brain</p>

<p>Keto-Adaptation: process in which the body
becomes accustomed to utilizing ketones as a
preferred fuel. This process can take weeks or
months depending upon general health or
performance goals</p>

<p>What is Fat-Adaptation?</p>

<p>Fat-adaptation occurs when you consistently
engage in endurance training or you
consistently limit carbohydrates in the diet
(while increasing fat consumption) or both!</p>

<p>Fat adaptation is simply your body’s way of
altering metabolism to prioritize fat use due to
exercise demands or in response to having
reduced carbohydrate energy. The most
abundant stored fuel source your body has is
fat. Therefore, if you have fasted for 12 or more
hours, you are likely to begin mobilizing fat for
fuel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Standard American Diet
(SAD) generally suppresses fat-adaptation,
primarily due to the abundance of refined
carbohydrate and sugar as well as constant
snacking. While the SAD promotes fat storage,
fat-adaptation helps improve your body&#39;s
capacity to use stored fat for fuel.</p>

<p>Why Become Fat-Adapted?</p>

<p>If you become fat adapted, you are less likely
to store fat on the body since you can mobilize
and burn fat more easily. Additionally, fat
aptation is associated with better metabolic
flexibility, which essentially describes the
ability to switch between fuel sources with
ease based on what&#39;s available. Metabolic
flexibility is precisely what your body needs
when stressed (illness, injury, etc.) to keep you
fit and healthy. Think of metabolic flexibility as
your body’s energy back-up plan.</p>

<p>How to Become Fat Adapted?</p>

<p>There are several ways you may become more
fat adapted. You can do so by fasting, reducing
carbohydrate intake, exercise training, or a
combination of these.</p>

<p>Fasting - Abstaining from Calorie intake will
gradually shift metabolism towards increased
reliance on fat, as glycogen stores are
depleted. Generally, fat metabolism becomes
the primary fuel at the conclusion of your
Catabolic fasting zone (around 16 hours).
However, there are several factors that might
influence this timing, including pre-fast
nutrition, body size, and physical activity.</p>

<p>Carbohydrate Restriction - When carbohydrate
intake is reduced, it is usually accompanied by
an increase in dietary fat and/or protein
consumption. Your body intuitively responds to
a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet by
upregulating fat metabolism while at rest and
during all low-to-moderate intensity exercise.</p>

<p>Each meal impacts which fuel gets priority. Not
surprisingly, a single high carbohydrate meal
will increase carbohydrate preference at rest.
The same is true for exercise. In other words,
eating carbs = burning carbs.</p>

<p>Training Status - trained individuals have
higher fat oxidation rates than untrained, and
will store more fats in the muscle tissue for
ease of access and direct use during activity.
Additionally, trained individuals have increased
mitochondria (number and quality) and
enzymes that work to create energy from fat.</p>

<p>There’s no consensus, currently, on a distinct
measure that tells you whether you&#39;re fat
adapted. This is in-part due to overlapping
metabolic changes that take place. It’s also
because fat adaptation is a process. Although
you can increase fat metabolism transiently,
like flipping a “metabolic switch”, fat-
adaptation takes more time to develop.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few metrics you can
track to gain some insight about your progress
toward fat-adaptation. They can be broken into
two different categories: “objective measures,”
which are more quantifiable and “subjective
signs,” which are more open-ended.</p>

<p>Objective Measures:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blood Glucose - Although it sounds
counter-intuitive, Glucose might be the
easiest and most economical test to
evaluate fat-adaptation. Reduction in
reliance on glucose with fat-adaptation
means a consistent reduction in fasted
blood glucose. Previous studies have
shown after low carbohydrate
consumption for 4-5 weeks fasted blood
glucose is reduced in diabteic patients
(-36%) and healthy participants (-15%)</p></li>
<li><p>Ketones - Increased fat metabolism (from
exercise, fasting, or reduction in dietary
carbohydrate) results in the production of
ketone bodies. Your ketone levels slightly
increase during an overnight fast, but
significant increases are associated with
extended fasts and/or low-carbohydrate/
ketogenic diets. Ketone bodies can be
measured in the urine, blood, and breath.
Blood ketone levels that suggest fat-
adaptation is present (or in-process) would
be 0.5-3 mM. Breath acetone levels that
indicate the same are 5-30 ACEs</p></li>
<li><p>Resting Respiratory Quotient (RQ) - when
we have carbohydrates on board, we burn
more glucose and resting RQ is higher (2
0.85), when blood sugar decreases, while
fasting or consuming a low carbohydrate
diet, resting RQ should be lower (s 0.85).</p></li>
<li><p>Enzymes - specific enzymes such as
Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL), HMG CoA
Synthase, and Acetyl Carnitine are
important for production and transport of
lipid-based fuels (fatty acids and ketones).
They are increased when blood glucose
and insulin levels are low during fasting or
in response to low-carbohvdrate diets.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Subjective Signs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fasting Apprehension - while fasting is not
effortless, there are many more difficult
tasks people complete all the time. If you
perceive fasting as being extremely
difficult, it may be an indication of reduced
metabolic flexibility meaning that your
body cannot as nimbly switch between
glucose and fat fueling preference.</p></li>
<li><p>Fed-state Persistent Hunger - symptoms
like hunger or headaches between meals
may be a sign that your insulin levels are
high and your ability to burn fat is reduced.
If you notice these consistently 3-4 hours
after eating it could be your body&#39;s way of
reminding you to consume more food and
carbohydrates, because you have
increased demand for glucose in order to
have continuous energy.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-Meal Fatigue (aka 2:30 slump) - This
is not the rare occurrence where you
might over-eat on a holiday and then feel
lethargic or desire an afternoon nap. If you
experience routine fatigue or lethargy
after meal time this might also be evidence
that your capacity to use fat as a fuel is
fairly low, as you slump after you&#39;ve
burned through your available glucose.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you don&#39;t experience any of the above
subjective indicators, you are probably
enjoying some fat-adaptation. If you
consistently cruise through your fasts, have
stable energy levels, can’t remember the last
time you had a headache, or rarely experience
ravenous hunger you might be fat-adapted!</p>

<p>Does Fat-Adaptation = Ketosis?</p>

<p>The short answer is no. You can become more
fat-adapted and not be in ketosis. Trained
individuals develop adaptations for increased
fat utilization through consistent exercise
without changing diet or having increases in
BHB concentration. But, as mentioned
previously, dietary practices including fasting
and ketogenic eating can impact fat-
adaptation.</p>

<p>If TRF is a consistent nutrition habit of yours,
then you are likely signalling a shift toward fat
metabolism and ketone production once your
fasts extend past 12 hours. However, during
your eating window, if you are not specifically
formulating your diet for ketosis, then you are
probably not remaining in a state of ketosis for
very long. Which is completely fine! Prolonged
fasting (&gt;72 hours) can cause a more stable
increase in ketone oxidation contributing
30-40% of total energy requirements. Even
when in ketosis, fatty acids remain the
predominant fuel to working skeletal muscles,
and this is contributing to fat-adaptation. So,
while fat-adaptation does not require ketosis,
ketosis can serve as a marker of positive fat-
adaptation progress.</p>

<p>How Long Does Fat-Adaptation Take?</p>

<p>Fat-adaptation is a process that takes some
time (usually on the order of 2+ weeks) where
key transporters and enzyme concentrations
change for improved fat burning capacity.</p>

<p>So, while we can rev up fat metabolism with a
single high-fat low-carb meal or a solo fast,
one or two of these things will not produce
long-term fat-adaption (although it is a good
start!). Similar to how you wouldn&#39;t expect your
muscles to appreciably grow after a single
bout of weight lifting, fat-adaptation requires
regular metabolic signaling to boost fat-
burning whether that be daily fasting, exercise,
and/or carbohydrate restriction. Fat-
adaptation is the product of lifestyle habits
rather than a couple of transient signals.</p>

<p>You can also reduce or lose your fat-
adaptation if you suppress fat burning signals
primarily through spiking insulin levels in your
body. It is reasonable to assume that regular
intermittent fasting can be a practical strategy
for signaling and maintaining some level of fat-
adaptation over time.</p>

<p>Fat-Adaptation helps to support metabolic
flexibility, which is a key component to healthy
aging. Becoming fat-adapted is a process that
takes some time (probably weeks or months).
You can signal changes through daily inputs
associated with your fast duration, meal
composition and exercise habits. Your daily
habits play an important role in establishing
your metabolic foundation. Investing in fat-
adaptation, as an energy “back-up plan,” can
help you to meet challenges or stress more
effectively down the road.</p>
