<p>This report provides a macro update for multiple asset classes, discusses the ongoing drawdown of the Treasury General Account, includes a large BTC and ETH update section, and then dives into Roku and Etsy.</p>
<p>As a housekeeping note, I just published a <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/gold-and-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public article on bearer assets</a> (i.e. gold and bitcoin) and why they have tended to be popular over the past decade.</p>
<p>Also, in recent weeks I’ve noticed a number of Youtube channels taking clips from my various interviews, and reposting them with extremely sensationalist titles. Please ignore those as they are not associated with me in any way. So far, I’ve been unable to get Youtube to take them down (whereas Twitter and Instagram tend to be very quick at responding to my reports of copycats/spammers). I have full control over what I write on this website or what I say on reputable interview channels, but I can’t necessarily stop spammers that aim for clickbait and take the content out of context on various spam channels. Please be conscientious of the content sources you consume from.</p>
<h2>Macro View</h2>
<p>Daily new COVID-19 cases are in a firm downtrend around the world:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-covid-cases.png" alt="COVID-19 Cases" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-covid-cases.png 679w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-covid-cases-300x219.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" width="679" height="495"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldometer</a></em></p>
<p>Some of the developed countries with high vaccination rates have their daily case counts near record lows, while other countries are still somewhat elevated but heading down too.</p>
<p>This May top that occurred should be the all-time high water market for daily cases, assuming that there is no variation that emerges this year that ignores vaccination or antibodies. The virus will stay with us for the foreseeable future but generally viruses get less intense as they hang around over time. I’m not a doctor so I’ll just continue to monitor the data and any policy actions that arise around it.</p>
<p><strong>Inflation and Bonds</strong></p>
<p>Thursday’s CPI report for May 2021 came in above consensus expectations. Economists on average were expecting a 4.7% year over year print, but they got about 5% instead. This comes after the April 2021 report that substantially overshot expectations as well.</p>
<p>This chart has year-over-year CPI, 10-year Treasury rates, and 3-month Treasury rates:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-inflation-and-rates.png" alt="Inflation and Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-inflation-and-rates.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-inflation-and-rates-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>Core CPI (meaning excluding food and energy) also came in at 3.8% year-over-year, which is the highest figure since 1992.</p>
<p>This continues to confirm my base case of a substantial reflation while the Fed maintains near-zero interest rates. As we look forward, however, June numbers (reported in July) are likely to be a bit under this 4.99% figure as base effects start to get a bit harder. The numbers will still be hot but in year-over-year terms, potentially less hot. Broadly, it’ll probably be somewhere in the 4.5% to 5.1% range.</p>
<p>By July (reported in August), the base effects will get tougher still, and the stimulus that has been passed will start to dwindle more into the rearview mirror. However, by then, energy markets could continue to get tighter and put upward pressure on gasoline prices. My base case is to expect a gradual rotation in the types of inflation we’re seeing.</p>
<p>The Treasury market has largely shrugged off the numbers, although it’s hard to separate market forces from central bank activity. The biggest buyer of long-duration Treasuries is currently the Federal Reserve with new bank reserves. This abundance of liquidity compared to the relatively limited amount of Treasury collateral is helping to keep yields pretty low, and well below the prevailing inflation rate.</p>
<p>As year-over-year inflation likely recedes from its May/June peak in Q3 due to harder base effects, the story about inflation being only transitory will gain more steam by the third quarter. Whether it is *actually* transitory will depend in significant part on what happens with further fiscal stimulus, as well as energy and rents and wages.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/may-2021-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May public newsletter</a> discusses different types of transitory inflation; transitory in rate-of-change terms (meaning it remains elevated for a while but stops going up, will probably happen for a period of time) vs transitory in absolute terms (meaning prices go back down to their starting point, which is unlikely). People who went overweight in bonds back in 2020 unfortunately already lost in terms of a stepwise increase in asset prices and CPI.</p>
<p><strong>TGA Drawdown</strong></p>
<p>The US Treasury has been drawing down its general account with the Fed since March of this year, towards more normal levels.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tga-drawdown-10year.png" alt="TGA Drawdown" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tga-drawdown-10year.png 683w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tga-drawdown-10year-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" width="683" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>I covered this back in my March 14th report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rising yields have been beneficial for the dollar lately. However, over the next 4 months, the Treasury General Account or “TGA” is projected to fall considerably, which all else being equal is likely a dollar-bearish variable. So far, it has only just started:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-3-14-tga.png" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-3-14-tga.png 672w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-3-14-tga-300x201.png 300w" alt="TGA Chart" width="672" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The dollar index indeed moved down a bit from around 92 to as low as sub-90 since then, and is now at about 90.5. The TGA still has a bit lower to go in the next 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p>When the Treasury Department issues bonds at a faster rate than it spends money, it builds up cash in its TGA account. Then, when the Treasury spends at a faster rate than it issues bonds, it draws down cash from the TGA.</p>
<p>The fact that the TGA has been drawn down over the past few months means that the Treasury has not had to issue a large amount of net Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, and along with the Fed purchasing $80 billion of them per month, it means that there has been very little in the way of net Treasury issuance for the private market to absorb.</p>
<p>All else being equal, this has put downward pressure on Treasury yields. I wasn’t sure if it would be a strong enough effect to do so against inflationary base effects, but indeed it has been.</p>
<p>However, in a few weeks we’ll be in the second half of 2021, which reminds me of <a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1361529545250267137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this thread</a> I wrote back in February, talking about the second half of 2021:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tweet-thread-tga.jpg" alt="Tweet Thread TGA" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tweet-thread-tga.jpg 609w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tweet-thread-tga-261x1024.jpg 261w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tweet-thread-tga-522x2048.jpg 522w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px" width="609" height="2389"></p>
<p>In the second half of this year, starting in Q3, I’d get a bit more concerned about the possibility of long-duration Treasury yields bouncing back up. The Treasury plans to issue nearly double as many net securities in Q3 than they are issuing here in Q2, for example. Issuance was low enough in Q2 that the Fed basically bought as much as the Treasury issued, but that won’t be the case in Q3. That means the private sector has to step up and buy more Treasuries. And since my thread, the SLR exemption expired and was not renewed, so banks have less capacity to buy Treasuries than when I wrote that.</p>
<p>Treasury rates going up would have a good probability of leading to another round of value stocks bouncing vs growth stocks, although it would also depend on the state of the economy at the time. It’s something to keep on our radar.</p>
<p>This also explains why the Fed isn’t rushing to taper their asset purchases. They know that about $800 billion in net Treasury issuance is coming in Q3 according to Treasury Department projections, and it would be hard for the private sector to absorb all of that without meaningfully higher rates. So, the Fed might tweak IOER, might taper their purchases of mortgage-backed securities, but aren’t ready to taper Treasury purchases yet, even with inflation running above their target level.</p>
<p><strong>Gold</strong></p>
<p>Gold, unsurprisingly, generally continues to inversely follow real yields.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-gold-vs-rates.png" alt="Gold vs Real Rates" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-gold-vs-rates.png 683w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-gold-vs-rates-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" width="683" height="450"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: St. Louis Fed</em></p>
<p>Inflation breakevens have rolled over lately, meaning the TIPS market expects a lower average 5-year and 10-year inflation number than it did a couple months ago, with the caveat that the Fed is involved as a buyer.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-inflation-breakevens.png" alt="Inflation Breakevens" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-inflation-breakevens.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-inflation-breakevens-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="416"></p>
<p>Investors should be careful how much weight they put in these inflation breakevens that the TIPS market projects outward.</p>
<p>This time last year, for example, 5-year inflation breakevens were less than 1% and the 5-year Treasury note was yielding under 0.35%. During the one year since then, the consumer price index already rose by 5%. This means that inflation as officially measured already more than outpaced all five years of interest that the 5-year notes issued at that time will pay until maturity. We would need to see a significant period of outright deflation for those notes to avoid losing purchasing power by the time they mature.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind when it comes to the topic of the bond market being “smart money”; in reality the bond market is solving for multiple variables including collateral shortages; not necessarily trying to accurately predict inflation. This is especially true with the Fed as by far the biggest buyer and with the TGA drawdown occurring, meaning there is very little net Treasury supply for the private market to buy.</p>
<p>It won’t be too long, only a quarter or two from now, until 10-year Treasury notes bought in mid-2020 have their entire ten years’ worth of coupons outpaced by the increase in CPI as well. Think about that: ten years of coupons outpaced maybe 16 months into the Treasury’s existence by price inflation. At that point, nothing short of a major period of deflation would make that note whole in real terms.</p>
<p>In other words, Treasuries make for good collateral in financial markets but their yields are not necessarily a good gauge of forward inflation, especially in this type of environment. So, when you see an analyst say that the bond market “thinks inflation is transitory”, be aware of those limitations. The bond market can and sometimes does lose purchasing power.</p>
<p><strong>S&amp;P 500 and Equity Factors</strong></p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 isn’t much higher than it was in May. It was choppy during May and lately has been slowly grinding higher.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-spx.png" alt="S&amp;P 500" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-spx.png 624w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-spx-300x233.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" width="624" height="485"></p>
<p>The value/growth ratio of the Russell 1000 has been generally flat since March 2021. No major factor outperformance either way. If we take a step back, however, the value/growth ratio does continue to make higher highs and higher lows for now:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-value-growth.png" alt="Value Growth Ratio" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-value-growth.png 652w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-value-growth-226x300.png 226w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" width="652" height="865"></p>
<p>My base case continues to be for ongoing value factor outperformance (especially if Treasury yields perk up a bit in Q3 as previously discussed), but it won’t be a straight line, and I do like select growth stocks in the portfolio mix as well, as I’ll show later in this report.</p>
<p><strong>Dollar Index</strong></p>
<p>This past week turned out to be an ideal time to take a vacation, considering that markets have been pretty boring.</p>
<p>Like many of these other indices, the dollar index has been chopping along sideways, neither breaking below the key support levels or showing any major break out either. It has curled up in a rounded bottom recently, which is worth watching for the moment since it could put more pressure on risk assets if it continues:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-dxy.png" alt="Dollar Index" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-dxy.png 746w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-dxy-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" width="746" height="468"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: Trading Economics</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Note</h2>
<p>Crypto markets have been wild lately. Fundamentals have been pretty good, while price action has been more mixed.</p>
<p>As I warned about in my May 9th report, the parabolic rise of tertiary altcoins showed the bubbly aspect of the sector.</p>
<blockquote><p>So far, 2021 has had an inverse relationship between quality and price action for the crypto space. Bitcoin and Ethereum have lagged Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, and one called Cumrocket in terms of percent price gains. A lot of this is… very bubbly. When Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash, and meme coins are going vertical, it’s a good time to check risk management for the space overall.</p>
<p>-May 9th Report</p></blockquote>
<p>Then the next week, between normal reports, I published an extra research note to highlight the breakdown in lumber prices and certain other commodity prices, along with the increasingly uncertain aspect of bitcoin’s price chart when it was at $46k, having broken below certain support levels with lower lows and lower highs.</p>
<blockquote><p>While I remain strategically bullish long-term on bitcoin as a base case, the intermediate-term tactical outlook is unclear. After large gains over the past year, it’s not as asymmetric of a position as when I originally recommended it.</p>
<p>-May 16th report</p></blockquote>
<p>My May 23rd report, after a sizable correction down to the low-$30ks area, dissected Grayscale’s impact on this market:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my view, the biggest negative variable for bitcoin’s rolling-over price action over the past four months is the fact that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) completely stopped buying bitcoin since February 2021. That weakened the underlying bullish price support, which allowed other headlines like Elon Musk’s tweets to shake price action pretty severely.</p>
<p>-May 23rd report</p></blockquote>
<p>The advantage of maintaining a moderate bitcoin position within the scope of a diversified portfolio is that it lets one ride through this volatility with less impact to total net worth. We’ve had a tremendous rise since the April 2020 entry point at $7k, but also significant volatility along the way, including multiple 25%+ price corrections and then more recently this 50%+ price correction.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning News</strong></p>
<p>I vacationed in Florida this past week, and spoke at the 2021 Bitcoin Conference held in Miami. I initially passed on attending when the event was announced last year, but when my friend <a href="https://lightning.engineering/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Stark</a>, the CEO of Lightning Labs reached out about an open slot, I decided to speak with her at the event.</p>
<p>There are people who only promote in the crypto industry, whereas Elizabeth is a builder, running a company and getting things done. I’m a fan of the development work her company is doing for Bitcoin’s lightning network, and we discussed in our talk the impact that the protocol can have on emerging markets including some of the work that is happening in El Salvador, and provided an overview of the broad development happening in the space.</p>
<p>About four hours later, during Jack Mallers’ speech at the conference, the president of El Salvador announced that he would submit a bill to the country’s legislature to make bitcoin legal tender along with the dollar. This means bitcoin would not be subject to capital gains taxes when transferred around, and would need to be accepted by most merchants as a means of payment and extinguishment of debt. In the days since then, this bill has now been passed, making El Salvador the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender.</p>
<p>For folks who aren’t familiar with the story, a couple years back there was a group that started “Bitcoin Beach” that initiated this chain of dominoes. They began using bitcoin (and specifically the lightning network, the faster transaction layer built on top of the Bitcoin network’s base layer) for payments within the local economy of a small surfer town. Then Jack Mallers of Strike (a fairly new app that uses the lightning network for fiat-to-fiat transactions) traveled to El Salvador and decided to emphasize that market as a test case. Strike’s focus in El Salvador was on remittances, since El Salvador is heavily reliant on remittance payments from family members in the United States, and they were paying big fees to Western Union and taking long bus rides to collect those remittances, and Strike could do peer-to-peer remittances between cell phones in a split second for a couple pennies. This app became one of the most popular apps downloaded in the country, and some lightning bitcoin wallet apps also spiked to the top. This beach+remittance combo was successful enough that El Salvador’s president took notice and made bitcoin legal tender in the country, trying to expand that approach to the rest of El Salvador.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how well that will do but the technology certainly seems to be helpful for the population, of which 70% is unbanked. Additionally, the country’s president has publicly spearheaded an effort to use geothermal energy from the country’s volcanoes for bitcoin mining as a revenue source.</p>
<p>I started paying pretty close attention to the lightning network in late 2020, since the functionality and liquidity started to hit critical mass rather than being merely theoretical.</p>
<p>From January of this year:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-lightning-importance.png" alt="Lightning Importance" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-lightning-importance.png 610w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-lightning-importance-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" width="610" height="489"></p>
<p>The number of lightning-enabled apps was becoming serious, and in particular Strike caught my attention around that time as well:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-strike-importance.png" alt="Strike Importance" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-strike-importance.png 611w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-strike-importance-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" width="611" height="915"></p>
<p>Indeed since then there has been an acceleration in public lightning network capacity in BTC terms:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-lightning-accelerating.jpg" alt="Lightning Accelerating" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-lightning-accelerating.jpg 680w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-lightning-accelerating-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" width="680" height="340"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/kerooke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kerooke</a></em></p>
<p>A lot of finance folks say bitcoin isn’t useful for anything other than price speculation, but from actually doing the legwork and speaking to developers and seed investors specifically involved with the lightning network about the progress happening there, this seemed to be a sleeper area that the market wasn’t realizing. I approached the topic the same as I would for any engineering project.</p>
<p>Lightning’s concept was put forth in a white paper in 2015. A set of specifications called the Basis of Lightning Technology (BOLT) was established in 2016, and this allowed multiple different companies to create implementations of lightning that were interoperable with each other to form a network. The 2017 SegWit update to Bitcoin allowed the lightning network to actually start being built on top of Bitcoin. From there, it took a couple of years of development to actually create the tools, build it out, and get enough liquidity to make it usable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-lightning-channels.png" alt="Lightning Channels" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-lightning-channels.png 610w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-lightning-channels-292x300.png 292w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" width="610" height="626"></p>
<p>It turns out that things took off faster than I would have guessed since I started taking the lightning network seriously late last year. “A small country adopts bitcoin as legal tender, mainly via lightning, and explores the use of volcano energy for domestic bitcoin mining,” was admittedly not on my 2021 bingo sheet. Additionally, politicians from a half dozen other Latin American countries quickly expressed interest in it as well.</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of questions about how well it will work for El Salvador (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/imf-sees-legal-economic-issues-with-el-salvador-bitcoin-move-2021-06-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and the IMF doesn’t seem pleased with it</a>), so for now we watch. I’m cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>Lightning still has limitations, and developers still have years of work ahead of them, but this young network, if it continues to be successful, scales the number of bitcoin payments that can occur per unit of time to any arbitrary level, cuts fees nearly to zero, and settles within a couple seconds whether the parties are right next to each other or on separate continents. The parties can do it custodially or non-custodially with bitcoin as the bearer asset, or they can use a service like Strike to do fiat-to-fiat payments using bitcoin for a fraction of a second as the intermediary, eventually including mixed fiat pairs like USD-to-BTC-to-EUR.</p>
<p>Overall, that’s probably my biggest takeaway from the 2021 Bitcoin Conference: that the lightning network is hitting critical mass of liquidity and applications. And as a tangible example, there were some gaming demos there involving lightning streaming, and THNDR Games processed 13,571 lightning transactions during the conference for an average fee of 1.4 sats per transaction, or roughly $0.0005 USD per transaction.</p>
<p>Jack Dorsey, the CEO of both Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ), has personally invested in lightning development. He recently promoted Sphinx Chat which is built on lightning, and recently showed interest in interfacing lightning with Twitter as well.</p>

<p><strong>Taproot News</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday morning, the Bitcoin network activated the Taproot update, which means it’ll take effect in November 2021. This has been in the works for a while, and will be the first major update to the Bitcoin network since SegWit in 2017. Well over 90% of the network (almost unanimous actually) signaled in favor of it; there is very little controversy about the technicalities of this update.</p>
<p>Taproot will improve the Bitcoin network’s ability to handle multi-signatures, and makes them indistinguishable from normal transactions. This improves transaction density and makes privacy a bit better, while adding more smart contract capabilities. A lightning channel being closed would be indistinguishable from a normal transaction, for example.</p>
<p>This not only improves bitcoin in a technical sense, but also proves that the slow-moving process for updating the Bitcoin network with near-complete consensus worked extremely smoothly this time around, which is bullish for future updates. It was a good procedure; very cautious and requiring massive consensus to go through.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Price Action</strong></p>
<p>While the fundamentals for bitcoin look great here with the legal tender news, the taproot update being activated, and the lightning network starting to hit critical mass, the price action is more mixed. Short-term traders, often with leverage, are far more in control of the price than the long-term hodlers at the moment.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s price has spent nearly a month bouncing between the high-$30ks and low-$30ks, with a series of lower lows and lower highs. Bitcoin has received some negative press from ransomware attacks and comments about cracking down on it by US politicians. On the other hand, influential billionaires can pretty easily move the price:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-bianco-tweet.png" alt="Bianco Tweet" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-bianco-tweet.png 606w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-bianco-tweet-229x300.png 229w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" width="606" height="795"></p>
<p>Until it breaks over $41k, it’s not very interesting as a tactical trade. Once it does that, it would get interesting again.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-btc-price.png" alt="BTC Price" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-btc-price.png 649w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-btc-price-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" width="649" height="398"></p>
<p>I continue to hold bitcoin as a long-term position based on assessments of its attractive network effect and unique properties, but the intermediate term is murky for the time being, and I have no particular conviction about price at the moment. According to on-chain data, long-term holders have gone back to accumulating bitcoin rather than selling it, while short-term traders have been the ones moving the price around. Excessive leverage on the long side has been generally wiped out in the space, which is good.</p>
<p>Over 140,000 net bitcoin moved to exchanges during the massive correction, but that has stopped for now. That’s also good.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-btc-exchanges.png" alt="BTC on Exchanges" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-btc-exchanges.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-btc-exchanges-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="393"></p>
<p>This upcoming week, MicroStrategy (MSTR) will get its hands on $500 million in more cash from a bond issuance to buy more bitcoin. So that’s another small bullish catalyst that should pull another 10,000+ bitcoin off of exchanges.</p>
<p>As we look out in late 2021 and into 2022, I think bitcoin rewards cards will become an increasingly important driver of demand and price. Fold and BlockFi have been launching ways to earn bitcoin on debit card purchases, and other crypto firms are moving in that direction as well. NYDIG also had public news that I reported on last month about partnering with banks for bitcoin custody solutions and bitcoin rewards.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-bitcoin-adoption.png" alt="Bitcoin Adoption Process" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-bitcoin-adoption.png 630w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-bitcoin-adoption-300x289.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" width="630" height="607"></p>
<h2>Ethereum Note</h2>
<p>Although I monitor a range of crypto tokens for research purposes, ETH is the only other coin besides BTC that I maintain price coverage on, since it has a substantial developer network effect and complicated monetary/technical changes currently underway.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum have different design priorities. Bitcoin keeps it simple on the base layer, and it’s decentralized enough that developers can’t realistically change the monetary policy. From there, other layers can be built on it to give it smart contract capabilities or increase its use for transactions (e.g. the lightning network, RSK, and Stacks 2.0). In that sense, it’s like TCP/IP as a protocol; simple and long-lasting but with plenty of stuff built on top of it. Ethereum, on the other hand, integrates smart contracts right into the base layer, and developers maintain more control to change its monetary policy or other aspects as needed with pre-programmed difficulty bombs.</p>
<p>I view bitcoin as a monetary protocol. Ethereum and altcoins, on the other hand, I view more like equities, since they represent a bet on the success or failure of a core development team.</p>
<p>While I have concerns about Ethereum’s long-term design and shift towards Ethereum 2.0 (the very ability to change its monetary policy shows how impermanent the monetary policy is), it’s hard to be bearish on price action in the intermediate term. EIP 1559, which I wrote about favorably in my otherwise somewhat critical public piece on Ethereum back in January, should be pretty bullish for price when it goes into effect. And with Ethereum 2.0 staking in effect since December 2020, ETH tokens continue to leave exchanges and get locked up. Implementing EIP 1559 while delaying the shift towards Ethereum 2.0 (which is basically the plan at the moment) is actually kind of a perfect storm for price in a positive way for the year ahead.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-eth-exchanges.png" alt="ETH on Exchanges" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-eth-exchanges.png 700w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-eth-exchanges-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" width="700" height="393"></p>
<p>So, while I have higher conviction on BTC than ETH with say a 5-year view, the specific dynamics holding up ETH prices are pretty strong for the back half of this year. It would need to break above $2,900 to get interesting again, though. Right now it’s in a sideways consolidation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-eth-price.png" alt="ETH Price" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-eth-price.png 645w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-eth-price-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" width="645" height="398"></p>
<p>One of the long-term bearish risks to watch for Ethereum is that any smart contract protocol can follow Ethereum’s path and potentially take market share. By being more centralized, they can be more efficient in terms of fees and throughput. That kind of defeats the purpose of a blockchain in theory, but in practice that’s what seems to be happening.</p>
<p>So for example, Tether stablecoins initially used to run on Bitcoin via the Omni layer (red), then switched over to Ethereum (green), and are now switching over to Tron (blue) because Ethereum fees became high:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tether-supply.jpg" alt="Tether Supply" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tether-supply.jpg 680w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-tether-supply-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" width="680" height="429"></p>
<p><em>Chart Source: <a href="https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/coin-metrics-state-of-the-network-217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coin Metrics</a></em></p>
<p>Basically, applications, other than ones tied specifically to the bearer asset of the given blockchain, can migrate to whatever smart contract blockchain is cheap. Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, and a bunch of other “Ethereum killers” all have the potential capability to eat into Ethereum’s market share over the long run.</p>
<p>Ethereum does have a huge developer network effect to keep competitors at bay, but competitors are seemingly chipping into it over time, and various applications have pretty low switching costs to move between blockchains.</p>
<p>In the meantime though, the squeeze coming from EIP 1559 and ETH 2.0 staking is tactically bullish if the price can convincingly break over $2,900.</p>
<h2>Portfolio Updates</h2>
<p>I consider the portfolios to be well-positioned for the current environment and haven’t made many changes lately. There are a few small changes for this week.</p>
<p>The full portfolios can be viewed in my Google Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Top 12 List</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletter Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-Dividend stock pie: Reduce BLK from 4% to 3%. Sell the 3% stake in AYI. Increase BNS, BMY and ICE from 4% to 5%. Increase CI from 3% to 4%.</p>
<p>-Growth stock pie: Reduce FB, AMZN, HDB, BABA, and JD from 12% to 10%. Reduce GOOGL, ADBE, FISV, and MSTR from 10% to 8%. Add ETSY as a 10% position and ROKU as an 8% position. I’m just diversifying the growth stock mix a bit to include these two names.</p>
<p><strong>Fortress Income</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>ETF-Only Portfolios</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>No Limits Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>-No current changes.</p>
<p><strong>Other Holdings</strong></p>
<p>-Sell September 17, 2021 cash-secured puts on ETSY with a strike price of $145.</p>
<p>-Sell September 17, 2021 cash-secured puts on ROKU with a strike price of $300.</p>
<p>These represent somewhat conservative ways to get exposure to the stocks. By selling the puts, I will get paid a premium to obligate myself to those purchases at strike prices that are below current prices. If they fall sharply from current levels in the next three months (perhaps due to rising Treasury yields in Q3?), I’ll enter with an attractive cost basis (strike price minus option premium). If they chop around or rise from current levels, I’ll keep the premium with about 5% gains in three months, my capital will get freed up in September, and I can decide what to do then.</p>
<p>The downside with that approach is that it takes a minimum of $14,500 and $30,000 respectively in order to initiate that position, since it can only be done in lots of 100 shares.</p>

<p>While I’m generally in favor of value stocks more than growth stocks with a multi-year view, there are some interesting opportunities opening up in the growth stock space after the sizable correction that many of them had this year.</p>
<p>I do, after all, have a growth stock section in my newsletter portfolio, and that section has outperformed most other things in the portfolio over the past couple years. Roku (ROKU) and Etsy (ETSY) are ones I’ve been watching among several others recently.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-roku-etsy-price.png" alt="ROKU ETSY Stock Price" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-roku-etsy-price.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-roku-etsy-price-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="416"></p>
<p>Despite sizable corrections, their stock prices are still higher than a year ago, which should give conservative investors a pause. However, their fast-growing businesses are much larger as well, so the valuation ratios have actually improved to varying extents, as discussed below. It’s hard to have super high conviction here until I see more of a confirmed bottom or a deeper capitulation related to higher Treasury yields, but the risk-adjusted returns are starting to look interesting enough to begin a gradual accumulation process.</p>
<p><strong>Roku Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Roku was founded in 2002. After a breakup with Netflix (NFLX), they released their first Roku box in 2008. Roku boxes give “smart” functionality to TVs, providing them with access to all sorts of streaming content including HBO Max, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and countless others. My household has one and it’s great.</p>
<p>Starting around 2014, Roku also began partnering with various smart TV manufacturers to use Roku’s operating system to serve as the TV’s smart functionality. With a Roku-enabled TV (recently branded as a “Roku TV”), you don’t need the separate Roku box, and Roku TVs now account for over a third of TVs sold in the US. In that sense, Roku has started to position itself as the “Windows” of TVs.</p>
<p>The company went public in 2017.</p>
<p>So, the company has been around for a while, but a lot of this was just laying the foundation. The real money is in the platform. The platform is Roku’s business where they collect ad revenue and streaming revenue from users for free and premium content respectively. Roku’s number of users keeps growing, and their revenue per user keeps growing (now about 3x as much per user as in 2016, from $9 to $32 per quarter). Only in the past few years has Roku become a powerhouse reaching critical mass, and as a public company.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, about three quarters of Roku’s revenue came from selling their hardware, and the remaining quarter was from the platform. Both have grown since then, but the platform portion has really taken off. Now, three quarters of Roku’s revenue is from the platform, and the remaining quarter is from the hardware. This is good for gross margins. Here’s the past year:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-roku-q1.png" alt="Roku Q1" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-roku-q1.png 667w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-roku-q1-300x255.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" width="667" height="568"></p>
<p><em>Source: Roku Q1 2021 Results</em></p>
<p>Roku is challenging to analyze because like Amazon (AMZN) used to do, Roku reinvests basically everything into growth. So, any price-to-earnings or price-to-free-cash-flow multiple is a joke, with extremely high numbers. An investment in Roku depends on a rough assessment of their growth potential during the next decade, rather than relying on current earnings. That’s the challenge.</p>
<p>Here is Roku’s quarterly revenue and price/sales ratio:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-roku-valuation.png" alt="ROKU Valuation" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-roku-valuation.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-roku-valuation-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="416"></p>
<p>You can see the regular Q4 holiday revenue spike on the purple revenue line. For the orange line, Roku’s market cap hit a bubble high of 33x revenue earlier this year when a bunch of other growth/ARKK stocks hit a peak, but now is down to “only” 22x. It’s still on the higher-end of average in terms of its historical valuation, but then again, it’s also a higher-margin business than it used to be, with a more persistent track record.</p>
<p>The balance sheet is very strong, with over $2 billion in cash-equivalents and less than $100 billion in long-term debt.</p>
<p>My ideal case would be to see one more deeper capitulation in price. I’d love to see 10-year Treasury rates spike, and a variety of growth stocks including Roku to drop sharply. That would be a great buying opportunity. I’m not sure if we’ll get it or not, but Roku at maybe 15x sales would be absolutely lovely.</p>
<p>When I’m looking at the 5+ year view, however, I’m less inclined to quibble about 30% price fluctuations that may or may not come, and willing to employ risk-mitigation strategies while buying into the stock. Roku’s revenue should be dramatically higher 5 years from now, and as they increasingly shift towards platform growth, their improving margins should propel them towards greater profitability.</p>
<p>So, while I’m not willing to go “conviction long” on Roku at this level, I think it has reached the point of being a good stock for dollar-cost averaging into at current prices (i.e. inclusion into the newsletter portfolio), or selling cash-secured puts against to get paid to wait to potentially purchase at a lower cost basis if a dip happens (i.e. inclusion into my other holdings). There is minor evidence of a rounded bottom forming in the stock price, so I’m not sure if we’ll get a lower entry point or not, even if I hope that we do.</p>
<p>Roku’s market cap is currently under $50 billion. I expect them to have a $150 billion market cap or more by the end of the decade. It will be a bumpy ride in the interim even if that is correct, but as part of a diversified portfolio I’m willing to absorb that volatility, with risk mitigation methods in place like dollar-cost averaging or careful cash-secured put-selling.</p>
<p>Currently, the stock price is $347. You can sell <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/selling-put-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cash-secured put options</a> at a strike price of $300 for September 17, 2021, and earn nearly $15 in premiums. In other words, if Roku remains above $300, you earn about 5% in premiums during a 3-month period (which is over 20% annualized). If Roku dips below $300, you buy at basically a $285 cost basis considering the strike price and premium combined, which I think is a pretty attractive long-term entry point for this company and is a 17% discount to current prices.</p>
<p><strong>Etsy Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Etsy was founded in 2005 and is a huge online market place for craft and vintage items. It has a market capitalization less than half of eBay’s (EBAY), but I expect it to eventually equal the size of that company in market capitalization as my base case.</p>
<p>Etsy acquired Reverb in 2019, which is a marketplace for instruments. High-end instruments last for decades and have huge re-sell value.</p>
<p>The company announced plans to acquire depop in 2021. This is a marketplace app for Gen Z clothing, and while it doesn’t appeal to me at all (frankly every picture I looked at looks bad), it apparently works well among that younger demographic. I’m not depop’s target audience, so who am I to judge?</p>
<p>Overall, Etsy’s main demographic is Millennial and Gen X women, Reverb’s main demographic is Millennial and Gen X men, and depop’s main demographic is a mix of male and female young Gen Z folks. Even on Etsy though, there are a lot of items for men. Women on the platform tend to buy those items for men in their lives, but there is also an approximately 20% of the userbase that consists of men directly. And of course the Reverb platform caters to anyone interested in instruments, and just happens to lean male.</p>

<p>While Roku has had a more explosive growth pattern, Etsy had a more gradual growth pattern (averaging 20%+ revenue per year) until COVID-19 put Etsy briefly into high-gear. Many people turned to buying and selling crafts during lockdowns, and in particular, there was a lot of commerce for making and buying custom masks on Etsy. This is starting to wear off now.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-etsy-valuation.png" alt="ETSY Valuation" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-etsy-valuation.png 650w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-etsy-valuation-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" width="650" height="416"></p>
<p>However, my base case is that the prior trend of 20%+ annual revenue growth will continue. This was a one-time stepwise increase in users and that rate of acceleration won’t continue, but a percentage of them will be sticky and the prior growth trend should resume. In a world of cheap products and corporatized retail, many people find value in hand-made crafts and vintage items, enabled by a marketplace with sizable network effects.</p>
<p>Etsy is actually trading near the low end of its historic price to cash flow ratio. Some of this is due to the market (correctly, in my view) expecting a relaxation of recent cash flow growth. But the point is, there isn’t exactly euphoria here. The market is exercising appropriate caution. I think the 5-year potential here is great, even if I don’t know how it’ll fare over the next 6 months.</p>

<p>Unlike Roku with its massive growth rate and Amazon-like reinvestment approach, Etsy has historically grown at a more moderate pace, and with positive free cash flow. The stock is currently trading at 33x analyst-consensus 2021 free cash flow and 25x analyst-consensus 2022 free cash flow, which isn’t too high considering their average growth rate.</p>

<p>Etsy also has more cash than long-term debt. The balance sheet is in great shape.</p>
<p>Overall, I’d be happy to buy Etsy and hold for 5 years as part of a diversified portfolio. However, I would prefer to see a bigger capitulation, and I just don’t know if we’ll get that or not. I’m willing to start dollar-cost averaging into it, or sell cash-secured puts against it.</p>
<p><strong>Growth Stock Risks</strong></p>
<p>Both Roku and Etsy have individual company or industry risks related to competition, execution, and other details. Roku has competition from Amazon Fire (AMZN) and Apple TV (AAPL), for example. I’m also concerned that since Roku is starting to produce some original content, that it could be a big cash flow sink like Netflix (NFLX) deals with. Meanwhile, Etsy is taking a mild risk with its depop acquisition, and faces general risk from Facebook (FB) and eBay (EBAY).</p>
<p>However, their larger risks from an investment standpoint are related to valuation. The underlying businesses are strong and hard to disrupt at this point with sufficient network effects, but the valuation multiples are on the high end (more-so for Roku than Etsy), so the main question is whether we’ll see deeper price corrections ahead.</p>
<p>One of my concerns in recent months was that I was expecting an inflationary spring/summer (which we’ve gotten so far), and wasn’t sure if Treasury yields would rise or not considering the TGA drawdown and other variables (so far, not so much). If Treasury yields rise in the second half of 2021, it can put pressure on highly-valued growth stocks again, since the discount rate goes up quite a bit.</p>
<p>We’ve seen growth stocks cooling off quite a bit, allowing for more attractive entry points, but I don’t know if this rise in Treasury yields is completely done for this cycle. If we get, say, an energy price spike in late 2021 or in 2022 along with the TGA no longer in drawdown mode, it could very well lead the Treasury market to wake up and bring yields higher.</p>
<p>So, my way of hedging that risk is simply to own plenty of energy stocks and other inflation hedges. My overall portfolios remain tilted towards value and inflation, but there are select growth stocks I’m willing to buy when they’re less hot, like Roku and Etsy here, as part of a balanced portfolio.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts: Move Forward, But With Caution</h2>
<p>One of my favorite investors, Howard Marks, has the quote, “move forward, but with caution”. In other words, don’t be paralyzed with fear, but have a sober analysis of risks.</p>
<p>Over the past year, I’ve gotten tons of emails from folks who are interested in the market but who are always concerned about the possibility of a crash. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 was under 3,100 this time last year, and now it’s over 4,200, and cash failed to keep pace with official measures of price inflation.</p>
<p>I think the fear is understandable, because many people just view stock indices as a price that goes up and down on a chart, rather than deeply understanding the investments they own. And that’s to be expected; most people have day jobs and don’t work full-time in finance.</p>
<p>When you own individual companies, or analyze an index carefully and look through the top companies and get a feel for their valuations, you can be more comfortable with the types of investments you hold.&nbsp;Some stocks are very heated in terms of valuation, while other ones are actually at below-average valuations. And there isn’t just one market. There are various international markets to select stocks or other assets from as well.</p>
<p>Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) for example is still at a single-digit forward P/E ratio:</p>

<p>Sberbank of Russia (SBRCY) is even cheaper:</p>

<p>If we head out of the realm of value and look into growth stocks, we see something like Facebook (FB) that is not exactly cheap, but that is completely in-line with its historical norm:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-fb-fastgraph.png" alt="FB FASTGraph" srcset="https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-fb-fastgraph.png 972w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-fb-fastgraph-300x179.png 300w, https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/premium-2021-6-13-fb-fastgraph-768x459.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px" width="972" height="581"></p>

<p>All of those stocks have risks, but overvaluation isn’t particularly one of them. I continue to like a large number of dividend-paying stocks, as well as some growth stocks and inflation hedges on either side of that mix.</p>
<p>There were multiple times over the past year where I was concerned about the levels of market euphoria, and raised a bit of cash, or focused a bit more on defensive stocks. But overall, the approach was to keep seeking value wherever it is, and that process is what I’ll keep doing.</p>
<p>Despite the negative real yields, I do hold some short-term bonds as dry powder (although I’m underweight them), along with gold for some defensive insurance. Investors could also buy into long volatility funds or use other means to hedge downside risk. But the point is, there are attractive investment opportunities out there, and while they may have volatility, maintaining a diverse collection of good stocks spreads out the risk and allows their compounding effects to work their magic for a portfolio over time.</p>
<p>In terms of risk awareness, some of the big things I’ll be watching in the months ahead are 1) how the economy performs with stimulus support fading away, 2) whether the Senate can pass an infrastructure bill or not, 3) how tight the energy market gets later this summer if at all, and&nbsp; 4) the TGA drawdown and Q3 net Treasury issuance.</p>
